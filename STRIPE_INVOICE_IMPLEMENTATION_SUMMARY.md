# Stripe Invoice Integration - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 What Was Built

A complete Stripe Invoicing capability detection and UI system that:
1. **Detects** if an organization's Stripe account has invoicing enabled
2. **Displays** appropriate UI based on invoicing status
3. **Guides** users to enable invoicing in their Stripe Dashboard
4. **Provides** quick links to manage invoices once enabled

---

## 📋 Complete Feature Overview

### Backend Implementation ✅

#### 1. Invoice Capability Detection ([convex/stripeConnect.ts:703-790](convex/stripeConnect.ts#L703-L790))

**What it does:**
- Queries Stripe API for `account.capabilities.invoicing` status
- Checks if business profile is set up (required for invoicing)
- Optionally verifies if any invoices have been created
- Only enables invoicing if BOTH capability is active AND business profile exists

**Detection Logic:**
```typescript
// 1. Check invoicing capability
const hasInvoicingCapability = capabilities?.invoicing === "active";

// 2. Check business profile
const hasBusinessProfile = !!(
  accountWithCapabilities.business_profile?.name ||
  accountWithCapabilities.company?.name
);

// 3. Overall status
const isInvoicingEnabled = hasInvoicingCapability && hasBusinessProfile;
```

**When it runs:**
- Automatically during `refreshAccountStatusFromStripe` action
- Triggered when user clicks "Refresh" button in Stripe Connect section
- Logs detailed status to console for debugging

#### 2. Invoice Settings Storage ([convex/organizationInvoiceSettings.ts](convex/organizationInvoiceSettings.ts))

**Schema:** Stored in `organization_legal.customProperties.invoiceSettings`
```typescript
{
  invoicingEnabled: boolean,
  collectionMethod: "charge_automatically" | "send_invoice",
  paymentTerms: "net_30" | "net_60" | "net_90" | "due_on_receipt",
  autoAdvance: boolean,
  defaultPaymentMethods: string[],
  customFooter: string,
  daysUntilDue: number,
  automaticTax: boolean
}
```

**Key Functions:**
- `getInvoiceSettings` - Retrieve settings for authenticated users
- `getPublicInvoiceSettings` - Public version for checkout pages
- `updateInvoiceSettings` - Update configuration
- `syncInvoiceSettingsFromStripe` - Sync settings when capability detected

#### 3. Webhook Handlers ([convex/paymentProviders/stripe.ts](convex/paymentProviders/stripe.ts))

**Events handled:**
- `invoice.created` → Log invoice creation
- `invoice.finalized` → Invoice ready to send
- `invoice.paid` / `invoice.payment_succeeded` → Payment received
- `invoice.payment_failed` → Payment failed
- `invoice.payment_action_required` → Additional action needed
- `invoice.marked_uncollectible` → Invoice written off

### Frontend Implementation ✅

#### 1. Invoice Settings Section ([stripe-invoice-section.tsx](src/components/window-content/payments-window/stripe-invoice-section.tsx))

**Three Display States:**

**A) Not Connected to Stripe**
- Shows info message directing users to connect Stripe first
- Links to Stripe Connect tab

**B) Invoicing Disabled (Current Test Account State)**
```
⚠️ Stripe Invoicing Not Configured

Your Stripe account doesn't have the invoicing
capability enabled yet.

Requirements:
✗ Invoicing capability must be active
✓ Business profile is set up

[Open Stripe Dashboard →]

After enabling, click Refresh to update status.
```

**C) Invoicing Enabled**
```
✅ Stripe Invoicing: Enabled

Configuration:
- Collection Method: send_invoice
- Payment Terms: net_30
- Days Until Due: 30
- Auto Advance: Yes

[View Invoices] [Create Invoice →]

Features:
✓ Create professional invoices with branding
✓ Automatically send invoices via email
✓ Accept payments with hosted pages
✓ Track payment status and reminders
✓ Integrate with Stripe Tax
```

#### 2. Integration ([stripe-connect-section.tsx](src/components/window-content/payments-window/stripe-connect-section.tsx))

**Location:** Added after Tax Settings section
- Lines 716-734: Invoice Settings section wrapper
- Uses `StripeInvoiceSection` component
- Only shows when Stripe account is connected
- Includes icon and section header

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Key Variables

**`orgStripeAccountId`** (renamed from `stripeConnectId` for clarity)
- Contains the organization's Stripe account ID (e.g., `acct_1HbNLqEEbynvhkix`)
- Retrieved from `organization.paymentProviders[].accountId`
- Used to construct dashboard URLs

### URL Structure

**All Stripe Dashboard links use:**
```
https://dashboard.stripe.com/${orgStripeAccountId}/{path}
```

**Examples:**
- Invoices list: `https://dashboard.stripe.com/acct_xxxxx/invoices`
- Create invoice: `https://dashboard.stripe.com/acct_xxxxx/invoices/create`

**Note:** The account ID in the URL automatically determines test/live mode, so no `test/` prefix needed.

### Console Logging

**During refresh, you'll see:**
```
🔍 Checking Stripe Invoicing capability...
📋 Account capabilities: { "invoicing": "active", ... }
💳 Invoicing capability status: active (or not found)
💳 Has invoicing capability: true/false
🏢 Business profile name: Your Business Name
🏢 Has business profile: true/false
📄 Has created invoices: true/false
🎯 Overall invoicing enabled: true/false
❗ Missing requirements: [list if disabled]
✅ Synced invoice settings (if enabled)
ℹ️ Invoicing not enabled - requirements not met (if disabled)
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Your Test Account Status (Working as Expected)
```
Account ID: acct_1SI7etCu17AthfgQ
Capabilities: {
  "card_payments": "active",
  "transfers": "active",
  // No "invoicing" capability listed
}

Business Profile: ✓ Set ("Vound Brand Dev")
Invoicing Capability: ✗ Not active
Result: Correctly shows "Not Configured" UI
```

**UI correctly displays:**
- Warning message about invoicing not configured
- Requirements checklist (showing what's missing)
- "Open Stripe Dashboard" button
- Instructions on how to enable
- Reminder to click Refresh after enabling

---

## 🎯 User Flow

### When Invoicing is Disabled (Current State)

1. **User opens Payments window → Stripe tab**
2. **Scrolls to "Invoice Settings" section**
3. **Sees warning:** "Stripe Invoicing Not Configured"
4. **Clicks:** "Open Stripe Dashboard" button
5. **Browser opens:** `https://dashboard.stripe.com/acct_xxxxx/invoices`
6. **User can then enable invoicing in Stripe**
7. **Returns to app and clicks "Refresh" button**
8. **System detects capability and updates UI**

### When Invoicing is Enabled (Future State)

1. **User sees green success card:** "Stripe Invoicing: Enabled"
2. **Configuration details displayed**
3. **Two action buttons:**
   - "View Invoices" → See all invoices
   - "Create Invoice" → Create new invoice
4. **Feature list shown with benefits**

## 🔍 How Detection Works

### Refresh Flow

```
User clicks "Refresh"
    ↓
refreshAccountStatus mutation
    ↓
refreshAccountStatusFromStripe action
    ↓
├─ Check Stripe Tax (already working)
│   └─ Sync if active
│
└─ Check Stripe Invoicing (NEW)
    ├─ Initialize Stripe API client
    ├─ Retrieve account with capabilities expanded
    ├─ Check capabilities.invoicing === "active"
    ├─ Check business_profile.name or company.name exists
    ├─ Query for existing invoices (optional)
    ├─ Calculate: isInvoicingEnabled = capability && profile
    │
    ├─ IF enabled:
    │   └─ syncInvoiceSettingsFromStripe
    │       └─ Store default settings in organization_legal
    │
    └─ IF disabled:
        └─ Return false status
            └─ UI shows "Not Configured" state
```

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Storage Location
**Decision:** Store invoice settings in `organization_legal.customProperties`
**Reason:** Same pattern as tax settings, keeps legal/financial config together

### 2. Detection Criteria
**Decision:** Require BOTH capability AND business profile
**Reason:** Business profile is required for Stripe Invoicing to work properly

### 3. URL Format
**Decision:** Use `dashboard.stripe.com/{accountId}/path` format
**Reason:** Direct link to organization's specific account, auto-handles test/live mode

### 4. UI State Management
**Decision:** Three distinct states (not connected, disabled, enabled)
**Reason:** Clear guidance at each stage of setup process

### 5. Variable Naming
**Decision:** Renamed `stripeConnectId` to `orgStripeAccountId`
**Reason:** Clarity - this is the org's Stripe account ID, not a connect platform ID
