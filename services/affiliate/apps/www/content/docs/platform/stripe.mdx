RefRef offers seamless integration with Stripe to handle payment processing, subscription management, and referral tracking for your programs.

## Overview

The Stripe integration enables you to:

- Track purchases and subscriptions as qualifying events
- Process commission payments to referrers and affiliates
- Sync customer data between systems
- Implement revenue sharing models
- Automate reward distribution

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the Stripe integration, you'll need:

- An active Stripe account
- API keys from your Stripe dashboard
- Administrator access to your RefRef account
- Basic understanding of Stripe's product structure

## Setting Up the Integration

### Step 1: Connect Your Stripe Account

1. Navigate to **Integrations** in your RefRef dashboard
2. Select **Stripe** from the available integrations
3. Click **Connect with Stripe**
4. Authenticate with your Stripe credentials
5. Grant the necessary permissions for RefRef

### Step 2: Configure Webhook Events

RefRef needs to listen for specific events from Stripe:

1. In the Stripe integration settings, review the webhook configuration
2. Ensure the following events are enabled:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `invoice.paid`
   - `customer.subscription.created`
   - `customer.subscription.updated`
   - `charge.succeeded`
3. Save your webhook configuration

### Step 3: Map Stripe Products to Qualifying Events

Connect your Stripe products and plans to RefRef qualifying events:

1. Go to **Qualifying Events** in your program settings
2. Select **Add Stripe Event**
3. Choose the Stripe products or plans that should trigger referral conversions
4. Configure conversion rules and reward values
5. Set attribution windows and validation criteria

## Tracking Referrals with Stripe

### One-time Purchases

For tracking one-time purchases:

1. Add the referral identifier to Stripe checkout metadata
2. RefRef will automatically attribute the purchase to the referrer
3. Configure reward rules based on purchase amount or product

Example code for adding referral data to Stripe checkout:

```javascript
const session = await stripe.checkout.sessions.create({
  line_items: [...],
  mode: 'payment',
  metadata: {
    refref_referral_id: 'REF123',
    refref_campaign: 'summer_promo'
  },
  ...
});
```

### Subscription Tracking

For subscription-based businesses:

1. Configure which subscription events trigger conversions
2. Set rules for initial subscription vs. recurring payments
3. Define reward structures for subscription tiers
4. Establish rules for subscription upgrades or downgrades

## Processing Rewards Through Stripe

RefRef can automatically process rewards and commissions through Stripe:

### Stripe Connect

For affiliate and partner payments:

1. Enable Stripe Connect in your integration settings
2. Configure payout schedules and thresholds
3. Set up tax form collection if required
4. Define commission structures and tiers

### Customer Credits and Discounts

For customer rewards:

1. Configure customer reward types in RefRef
2. Set up automatic discount application
3. Define credit application rules for future purchases
4. Configure notification templates for reward issuance

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Events

Create custom qualifying events based on specific Stripe webhook data:

1. Navigate to **Custom Events** in your integration settings
2. Define event criteria using Stripe webhook data
3. Set up reward rules for these custom events
4. Test the configuration with sample webhook data

### Multi-currency Support

For businesses operating in multiple currencies:

1. Configure currency settings in your integration
2. Set up currency conversion rules
3. Define reward values for different currencies
4. Establish payout preferences by currency

## Webhooks and API

### RefRef to Stripe

RefRef can send data to Stripe for:

- Creating promotional codes
- Applying discounts
- Updating customer metadata
- Managing subscription features

### Stripe to RefRef

Stripe sends webhook events to RefRef for:

- Purchase confirmation
- Subscription status changes
- Payment success or failure
- Customer updates

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Missing Webhooks**: Verify webhook configuration in Stripe
- **Attribution Errors**: Check referral parameter passing in checkout
- **Payout Failures**: Verify Stripe Connect account setup
- **Duplicate Events**: Check webhook configuration for duplicate notifications

## Best Practices

- Test the integration thoroughly in Stripe's test mode before going live

- Keep your Stripe API version updated in RefRef
- Monitor webhook delivery and processing in both systems

By leveraging the RefRef-Stripe integration, you can create powerful, automated referral programs that seamlessly track conversions and distribute rewards.
