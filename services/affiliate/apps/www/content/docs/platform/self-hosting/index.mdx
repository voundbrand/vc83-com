# Self-Hosting RefRef

This guide provides instructions for deploying and maintaining your own instance of RefRef on your infrastructure.

## Why Self-Host RefRef?

Self-hosting RefRef offers several advantages:

- **Complete Data Control** - Keep all your referral and customer data within your own infrastructure
- **Custom Integrations** - Deeper integration with your existing systems
- **Compliance Requirements** - Meet specific regulatory or industry requirements
- **White-Labeling** - Full customization of the platform appearance
- **Cost Efficiency** - Potentially lower costs for high-volume usage

## System Requirements

### Minimum Requirements

- **CPU**: 2 cores
- **RAM**: 4GB
- **Storage**: 20GB SSD
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 13+, Redis
- **Node.js**: v16+
- **Docker**: 20.10+ (if using containerized deployment)

### Recommended for Production

- **CPU**: 4+ cores
- **RAM**: 8GB+
- **Storage**: 50GB+ SSD
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 14+ with replication
- **Load Balancer**: For high-availability setups
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus/Grafana stack

## Deployment Options

### Docker Deployment

For Docker-based deployments, please refer to our [Docker Setup Guide](/docs/platform/self-hosting/docker).

### Manual Installation

For environments without Docker:

1. Clone the RefRef repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Configure environment variables
4. Set up the database
5. Build the application
6. Start the server

## Configuration

RefRef is configured primarily through environment variables:

- **Database Connection**: Configure PostgreSQL connection details
- **Authentication**: Set up authentication providers
- **Email**: Configure SMTP settings for notifications
- **Storage**: Set up file storage options
- **API Keys**: Configure integration credentials

## Upgrading

To upgrade your self-hosted RefRef instance:

1. Back up your database and configuration
2. Pull the latest version or download the new release
3. Apply any necessary database migrations
4. Restart the application

We recommend testing upgrades in a staging environment before applying to production.

## Security Considerations

When self-hosting RefRef, consider these security best practices:

- Run RefRef behind a reverse proxy with SSL/TLS
- Implement proper network segmentation
- Use strong, unique database credentials
- Regularly apply security updates
- Implement proper backup procedures
- Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF)

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

- **Database Connection Errors**: Check connection strings and network access
- **Email Sending Failures**: Verify SMTP configuration and credentials
- **Performance Issues**: Review resource allocation and database indexing
- **Integration Problems**: Validate API keys and endpoint configurations

## Community Support

As an open-source project, RefRef has an active community of users and contributors:

- **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs or request features
- **Discord Community**: Get help from other self-hosters
- **Documentation**: Contribute improvements to our guides
- **Enterprise Support**: Commercial support options available for mission-critical deployments
