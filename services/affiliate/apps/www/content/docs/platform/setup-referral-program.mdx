This guide walks you through the process of creating and configuring a referral program using RefRef.

## What is a Referral Program?

A referral program is a systematic way to encourage your existing customers to recommend your products or services to their friends, family, or colleagues. In exchange for successful referrals, you typically offer rewards to the referrer, the referred person, or both.
