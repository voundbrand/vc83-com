## Tracking Referrals with PayPal

### One-time Purchases

For tracking standard PayPal purchases:

1. Add the referral identifier to the PayPal checkout flow
2. RefRef will automatically attribute the purchase to the referrer
3. Configure reward rules based on purchase amount or product

Example of adding referral data to PayPal checkout:

```javascript
// Adding referral data to PayPal checkout
paypal.Buttons({
  createOrder: function(data, actions) {
    return actions.order.create({
      purchase_units: [{
        amount: {
          value: '19.99'
        },
        custom_id: 'refref_id=REF123&refref_campaign=summer_promo'
      }]
    });
  },
  onApprove: function(data, actions) {
    // Handle successful payment
  }
}).render('#paypal-button-container');
```

### Subscription Tracking

For PayPal subscription products:

1. Configure which subscription events trigger conversions
2. Set rules for initial subscription vs. recurring payments
3. Define reward structures for different subscription values
4. Establish rules for subscription changes

## Processing Rewards Through PayPal

1. Configure PayPal as a payout method in RefRef
2. Set up automatic or manual approval workflows
3. Define payout schedules and thresholds
4. Configure notification templates for payout processing

### Mass Payouts

For efficiently managing multiple payouts:

1. Navigate to **Mass Payouts** in your integration settings
2. Configure batch payout settings
3. Set up approval workflows for batch processing

## Advanced Configuration

### Multi-currency Support

For businesses operating internationally:

4. Set up webhook handling for custom implementations

## Webhooks and API

### RefRef to PayPal

RefRef can send data to PayPal for:

- Creating payout transactions
- Processing mass payouts
- Generating invoices
- Verifying account information

### PayPal to RefRef

PayPal sends webhook events to RefRef for:

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

## Best Practices

- Test the integration thoroughly in PayPal's sandbox environment before going live
