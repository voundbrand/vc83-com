## Tracking Referrals with Chargebee

### Initial Subscriptions

For tracking new subscription sign-ups:

1. Add the referral identifier to the Chargebee checkout or hosted page
2. RefRef will automatically attribute the subscription to the referrer
3. Configure reward rules based on subscription plan or value

Example of adding referral data to a Chargebee checkout:

```javascript
// Adding referral data to Chargebee checkout
Chargebee.getInstance().openCheckout({
  hostedPage: hostedPageObj,
  loaded: function() {
    console.log("Checkout loaded");
  },
  success: function(hostedPageId) {
    // Handle success
  },
  close: function() {
    // Handle close
  },
  step: function(value) {
    // Handle step change
  },
  metadata: {
    refref_id: "REF123",
    refref_campaign: "summer_promo"
  }
});
```

### Subscription Lifecycle Events

For ongoing subscription management:

1. Configure which subscription events trigger rewards
2. Set rules for renewals, upgrades, and downgrades
3. Define reward structures for different subscription tiers
4. Establish rules for subscription longevity milestones

## Processing Rewards

RefRef can automatically process rewards based on Chargebee subscription events:

### Monetary Rewards

1. Configure payout methods in RefRef
2. Set up automatic or manual approval workflows
3. Define payout schedules and thresholds
4. Configure notification templates for reward issuance

### Subscription Credits

1. Configure subscription credits or discounts
2. Set up automatic application to Chargebee subscriptions
3. Define credit application rules and durations
4. Establish delivery methods for subscription rewards

## Advanced Configuration

For rewards based on Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR):

1. Navigate to **Advanced Rewards** in your integration settings
2. Configure MRR-based reward tiers

4. Track performance metrics by subscription tier

## Webhooks and API

### RefRef to Chargebee

RefRef can send data to Chargebee for:

### Chargebee to RefRef

Chargebee sends webhook events to RefRef for:

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Missing Webhooks**: Verify webhook configuration in Chargebee
- **Attribution Errors**: Check referral parameter passing in checkout

## Best Practices

- Test the integration thoroughly in Chargebee's test environment before going live
