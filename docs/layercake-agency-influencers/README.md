## The Layer Cake Value Prop

**What it is:**
Multi-tenant platform that takes v0 prototypes to production-ready apps with pre-built backend modules (auth, Stripe, CRM, database, messaging).

**The problem it solves:**
Agencies can build custom apps in 2 days instead of 2 weeks. Charge €3,000 for work that used to cost €15,000.

**Why affiliates should care:**
- **High ticket:** $499/mo = $200/mo recurring commission per referral
- **Sticky product:** Agencies build their business on it → low churn
- **Growing market:** AI app builders are hot, but backend is the bottleneck everyone ignores
- **Differentiation:** GoHighLevel = marketing automation. Layer Cake = custom app builder.
