# Message Architecture: Agency Influencer Affiliate Recruitment

> Core messaging building blocks for all outreach

---

## The Big Idea

**One sentence:**
> Layer Cake turns v0 prototypes into production apps with pre-built backend — agencies deliver in 2 days, not 2 weeks.

**For affiliates:**
> Promote the platform that's about to change how agencies build software. 40% recurring, lifetime.

## Hooks (Attention)

### Hook 1: The Competitor Angle
> "You're promoting GoHighLevel — but your audience still can't build custom apps fast. Layer Cake fixes that."

*Best for:* GHL affiliates who want complementary, not competing, offers

### Hook 2: The Math Hook
> "10 referrals = $2,000/month. Forever. Want in?"

*Best for:* Influencers who respond to numbers

### Hook 3: The Exclusivity Hook
> "We're taking 20 founding affiliates. Wanted to see if you're interested before we fill up."

*Best for:* Creating urgency and FOMO

### Hook 4: The Problem Hook
> "Every agency owner I know loves v0 for prototyping — but hates the backend work to make it real. We solved that."

*Best for:* Influencers whose audience uses v0, Lovable, Bolt, etc.

### Hook 5: The Recognition Hook
> "Saw your video on [specific topic] — your audience would crush it with Layer Cake."

*Best for:* Personalized outreach showing you've done homework

## Problem (Relevance)

### External Problem (Tangible)
> "Agencies can prototype beautiful apps in hours with AI tools. But turning those into production apps with auth, payments, and databases still takes weeks and costs a fortune."

### Internal Problem (Emotional)
> "Agency owners feel stuck — they can show clients amazing mockups, but delivering the real thing is a nightmare. They're leaving money on the table or burning out trying to hack it together."

### Philosophical Problem (Injustice)
> "It shouldn't be this hard. The frontend is solved. Why is the backend still stuck in 2015?"

### Combined Problem Statement
> "Your audience can prototype apps in minutes, but they're still spending weeks on backend. That's broken — and we fixed it."

## Solution (Your Offer)

### What Layer Cake Does
> "Layer Cake takes any v0 prototype and connects it to pre-built backend modules — authentication, Stripe payments, CRM, database, messaging. Agencies go from prototype to production in days, not weeks."

### The Differentiation
> "GoHighLevel is for marketing automation. Layer Cake is for building custom software. They're not competitors — they're complements. Your audience needs both."

### Proof Points
- Multi-tenant architecture (agencies can white-label)
- Built-in v0 API integration
- Pre-built modules (auth, payments, CRM, messaging)
- Live builder in the platform

### The Result
> "Agencies can now charge €3,000 for work that used to cost €15,000. Same profit, 5x less effort. That's a business model transformation."

## CTA (Action)

### Primary CTA (Meeting)
> "Want to see a 5-minute demo? I'll show you exactly how it works and we can talk affiliate terms."

### Soft CTA (Interest)
> "Does this sound like something your audience would use? Happy to share more details."

### Urgency CTA (Scarcity)
> "We're capping founding affiliates at 20. If this sounds interesting, let me know and I'll send over the details."

### Low-Friction CTA (Resource)
> "I put together a quick overview of the affiliate program — want me to send it over?"

## Objection Responses

### "I already promote GoHighLevel"
> "Perfect — Layer Cake isn't a competitor. GHL handles marketing automation. Layer Cake handles custom app development. Your audience uses both. This is additive revenue, not replacement."

### "Never heard of Layer Cake"
> "That's the point — we're new, which means you get founding affiliate terms (40% lifetime + $100 bonus per sale). In 6 months, everyone will know us. You can be the one who introduced them."

### "My audience won't buy this"
> "If they've ever used v0, Lovable, Bolt, or complained about 'the backend part' — they need this. It's the missing piece everyone's been waiting for."

### "What makes this different from Bubble/Webflow?"
> "Bubble and Webflow are great for certain use cases. Layer Cake is specifically for agencies turning AI prototypes into production apps with enterprise features — auth, payments, multi-tenancy. It's the full stack, not just the frontend."

### "I don't do affiliate marketing"
> "No problem — we're also open to sponsorships or one-time partnerships. What structure works best for you?"

### "The commission sounds too good"
> "It matches GoHighLevel — they've proven this model works. High commission + high retention = sustainable. We'd rather pay affiliates than spend on ads."
