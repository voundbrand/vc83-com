## LinkedIn Sequence (5-Touch)

### Touch 0: Connection Request

**Template A: Specific Recognition**
```
Hey [Name] — been watching your content on [specific topic]. Your breakdown of [specific video/post] was sharp.

Building something I think your audience would love. Would love to connect.
```

**Template B: Mutual Interest**
```
[Name], noticed we're both in the agency software space. You're doing great work educating agency owners.

Building Layer Cake (AI app builder for agencies) — think there might be some interesting overlap. Connect?
```

---

### Touch 1: The Intro (Day 1 after accept)

**Template:**
```
Hey [Name], thanks for connecting!

Quick context: I'm building Layer Cake — it takes v0 prototypes and turns them into production apps with pre-built backend (auth, Stripe, CRM, database).

Basically, agencies can deliver custom apps in days instead of weeks.

We're launching our affiliate program and I immediately thought of you. Your audience is exactly who this is built for.

Interested in learning more?
```

---

### Touch 2: The Value Drop (Day 4)

**If they replied:**
```
Great to hear you're interested!

Here's the quick overview:
- 40% recurring commission, lifetime
- $599/mo product = ~$240/mo per referral
- 10 referrals = $2,000/month passive

We're taking 20 founding affiliates who also get:
- $100 bonus per first sale
- Featured on our affiliate page
- Custom content for your audience

Want to see a quick demo? I can show you exactly how it works.
```

**If no reply:**
```
Hey [Name], following up on my last message.

Quick math that might interest you: 10 referrals = $2,000/month recurring.

We're doing 40% lifetime commission (matches GoHighLevel), and we're limiting founding affiliates to 20.

Thought you'd want first look. Worth a quick chat?
```

---

### Touch 3: Social Proof / Different Angle (Day 10)

**Template A: Complementary Angle (for GHL promoters)**
```
[Name], one more thought —

I know you promote GoHighLevel (smart move, 40% recurring is great).

Layer Cake isn't a competitor — it's complementary. GHL = marketing automation. Layer Cake = custom app building.

Your audience needs both. This is additive revenue, not replacement.

Happy to show you the difference in a quick call if helpful.
```

**Template B: Problem Angle (for design/dev influencers)**
```
[Name], random thought —

Every designer I know loves v0 for prototyping. But the "now make it real" part — auth, payments, database — that's still a nightmare.

Layer Cake is literally built to solve that. Takes v0 output and connects it to production backend in minutes.

If your audience is building apps for clients, this is the missing piece.

Worth chatting about the affiliate program?
```

---

### Touch 4: The Direct Ask (Day 16)

**Template:**
```
Hey [Name], I'll be direct —

We're looking for 20 founding affiliates for Layer Cake. 40% recurring lifetime, $100 bonus per sale.

Your content on [specific topic] shows you get what agency owners need. This is built for your audience.

Two options:
1. Quick 15-min call to see the product + affiliate terms
2. I send you a demo account to play with first

Which works better?
```

---

### Touch 5: The Breakup (Day 25)

**Template:**
```
Hey [Name], I'll keep this short.

Totally get it if the timing isn't right or this isn't a fit.

If things change, the door's open. We'll probably fill the founding affiliate spots soon, but I'd happily make room for you later.

Either way, keep crushing it with your content. Your audience is lucky to have you.

Cheers,
[Your name]

## Email Sequence (5-Touch)

### Email 1: The Pattern Interrupt

**Subject:** `[Name], quick affiliate opportunity`

```
Hi [Name],

Been watching your content on [specific topic] — your [specific video/episode] was particularly insightful.

I'm reaching out because I think there's a fit between your audience and something we're building.

Layer Cake turns AI prototypes (v0, Lovable, etc.) into production apps with pre-built backend — auth, payments, CRM, database. Agencies can deliver custom apps in days, not weeks.

We're launching our affiliate program: 40% recurring, lifetime. 10 referrals = $2,000/month.

Taking 20 founding affiliates. Interested in learning more?

[Your name]
Layer Cake
```

### Email 2: The Value Email (Day 4)

**Subject:** `Re: [Name], quick affiliate opportunity`

```
Hi [Name],

Following up on my last email.

Here's why I think this is worth your attention:

THE PRODUCT:
Layer Cake takes v0 prototypes → production apps with auth, payments, database. Agencies go from "cool mockup" to "working software" in days.

THE AFFILIATE DEAL:
- 40% recurring commission (matches GoHighLevel)
- Lifetime duration
- $599/mo product = ~$240/mo per referral
- Founding affiliates get $100 bonus per sale

THE AUDIENCE FIT:
If your followers build websites, apps, or software for clients — this is their biggest pain point solved.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if there's a fit?

[Your name]

### Email 3: The Social Proof Email (Day 9)

**Subject:** `How [Similar Influencer/Agency] is using Layer Cake`

```
Hi [Name],

Quick update — [testimonial or early adopter story if available, otherwise use hypothetical].

"We used to spend 2 weeks on backend for every client app. Now it's 2 days." — [Agency]

That's the transformation Layer Cake delivers. And it's why I think your audience would crush it with this.

For affiliates, the math is simple:
- 10 agencies × $600/month = $2,400/month to you
- Recurring. Lifetime. Forever.

Still have founding affiliate spots open. Want in?

### Email 4: Different Angle (Day 15)

**Subject:** `Different approach, [Name]?`

```
Hi [Name],

I've sent a few emails — I'll try a different angle.

If you're already promoting GoHighLevel or similar, Layer Cake isn't a competitor. It's the other half of the puzzle.

GHL = marketing automation
Layer Cake = custom app development

Your audience needs both. This is additive revenue.

If affiliate marketing isn't your thing, we're also open to sponsorships or one-time partnerships.

What structure works for you?

[Your name]
```

### Email 5: The Breakup (Day 22)

**Subject:** `Closing the loop`

```
Hi [Name],

I'll keep this brief.

Seems like the timing isn't right — totally understand.

If things change, door's always open. We'll probably fill founding affiliate spots soon, but I'd make room for you.

Keep doing great work. Your audience is lucky to have you.

[Your name]

## YouTube Comment → DM Strategy

### Step 1: Comment on Recent Video
```
This is gold, [Name]. The part about [specific point] really clicked.

Question: have you looked at tools that take AI prototypes (like v0) to production? Curious what you think is missing in that space.
```

### Step 2: Wait for Reply or 48 Hours

### Step 3: DM Reference
```
Hey [Name], commented on your recent video about [topic].

That question I asked wasn't random — I'm building exactly that: Layer Cake takes v0 prototypes to production apps.

We're launching affiliate program (40% recurring lifetime). Thought you'd want first look.

Worth chatting?

## Podcast Pitch (for Tier 2)

**Subject:** `Guest pitch: The tool changing how agencies build apps`

```
Hi [Name],

Big fan of [Podcast Name] — particularly your episode on [specific topic].

I'd love to come on and talk about a shift happening in how agencies deliver software:

THE STORY:
AI tools like v0 can prototype apps in minutes. But turning those into production apps with auth, payments, and databases still takes weeks. We built Layer Cake to bridge that gap.

WHAT YOUR LISTENERS GET:
- How agencies can deliver custom apps in 2 days instead of 2 weeks
- The economics of AI-powered app development (charge €3K for what used to cost €15K)
- Where the industry is headed in 2026

Happy to tailor the conversation to what resonates with your audience.

Worth exploring?

[Your name]
Founder, Layer Cake
