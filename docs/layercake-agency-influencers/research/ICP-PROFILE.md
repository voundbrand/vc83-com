## Influencer Tiers

### Tier 1: GoHighLevel Ecosystem (Highest Priority)

These influencers already promote agency software with affiliate programs. They understand the model.

**Examples:**

- **Christine Seale** — "Automation Queen," promotes via Facebook Groups + live trainings
- **Dominic Baptist** (Serio Systems) — Builds white-label SaaS on GHL

**Why they're ideal:**
- Already monetizing with SaaS affiliate programs
- Audience is pre-qualified (agency owners looking for tools)
- Understand recurring commission value
- Proven track record of converting

**Positioning for them:**
"Layer Cake isn't a GHL competitor — it's complementary. GHL = marketing automation. Layer Cake = custom app building. Your audience needs both."

**Positioning for them:**

## Pain Points (What Affiliates Care About)

### 1. Commission Structure
- **Want:** High recurring percentages (30-50%), lifetime duration
- **Hate:** Low one-time bounties, short cookie windows, caps on earnings
- **Layer Cake advantage:** 40% recurring lifetime matches best-in-class (GHL)

### 2. Product-Market Fit
- **Want:** Something their audience actually needs and will buy
- **Hate:** Promoting products that don't convert or have high churn
- **Layer Cake advantage:** Solves real pain (backend complexity), sticky product

### 3. Promotional Support
- **Want:** Demo accounts, swipe copy, video assets, co-marketing opportunities
- **Hate:** Being left to figure it out themselves
- **Layer Cake advantage:** TBD — need to build affiliate resource kit

### 4. Exclusivity / Early Access
- **Want:** Being "first" to promote something new
- **Hate:** Promoting same thing as everyone else
- **Layer Cake advantage:** New platform, limited affiliates = exclusivity angle

### 5. Alignment with Audience
- **Want:** Products that genuinely help their community
- **Hate:** Being seen as "sellouts" pushing bad products
- **Layer Cake advantage:** Actually solves a massive pain point

---

## Buying Triggers (What Makes Them Say Yes)

1. **They see others succeeding** — Social proof from other affiliates
2. **Exclusive opportunity** — "We're only working with 20 affiliates at launch"
3. **Product demo blows their mind** — Show the 2-day app build
4. **Commission math is compelling** — "$2,000/mo passive from 10 referrals"
5. **Low effort required** — "We'll give you everything you need"

## Objections (Anticipated)

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I already promote GHL" | "Layer Cake isn't a competitor — it's complementary. GHL = marketing. Layer Cake = custom apps. Your audience needs both." |
| "Never heard of Layer Cake" | "We're new — that's why we're offering founding affiliate terms. You get in before everyone else." |
| "My audience won't buy this" | "If they use v0, Webflow, or any prototyping tool, they're struggling with backend. This solves that." |
| "I don't do affiliate marketing" | "We also do sponsorships/partnerships. What structure works for you?" |
| "Seems complicated to explain" | "Here's our 2-minute demo. Your audience will get it immediately." |
