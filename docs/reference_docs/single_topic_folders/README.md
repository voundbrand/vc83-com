# Single Topic Folders (Consolidated)

Purpose:
- store former one-file top-level topic folders in a single support location
- reduce top-level docs folder sprawl

Moved from top-level `docs/`:
- `affiliate_software/`
- `callcenter_ai/`
- `compliance_gdpr/`
- `concepts/`
- `donald_miller/`
- `extend_crm/`
- `external-apps-auth/`
- `integrations/`
- `patterns/`
- `v0_to_production_app/`
- `windows_refactor/`

Rule:
- add new single-topic references here (or to canonical architecture docs), not as new top-level folders
