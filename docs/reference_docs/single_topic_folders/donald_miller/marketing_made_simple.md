# Marketing Made Simple Workbook

## Your Playbook for Building a Successful Sales Funnel

---

## Introduction

Marketing should be easy and it should work. But most business leaders struggle with marketing. They spend money on websites that don't work, need to send sales emails but have no idea what to say, and are at a loss when leads slow down.

**The secret to solving these marketing problems is a sales funnel.**

### How a Sales Funnel Benefits Your Company

- They are inexpensive
- You can create them on your own
- No more guessing if you hire a marketing agent—you know what the deliverables should be
- They get an enormous return
- They win over clients without being pushy

---

## The Three Phases of Relationship

All relationships move through three phases. A sales funnel builds relationships with your customers over time by obeying these phases.

### 1. CURIOSITY

**Notes:**

### 2. ENLIGHTENMENT

**Notes:**

- _________________________________
- _________________________________

### 3. COMMITMENT

**Notes:**

- _________________________________

> **Key Insight:** Your marketing collateral should guide your customers through the phases of relationship. If we ask for a commitment before the customer is ready, we will come off as pushy and demanding.

## The Five Parts of a Sales Funnel

A sales funnel guides your customers through the phases of relationship at the natural speed of relationship:

1. **One-liner**
2. **Website**
3. **Lead Generator**
4. **Nurture Campaigns**
5. **Sales Campaign**

### Self-Assessment Checklist

- [ ] Is my marketing collateral asking for the sale too soon?
- [ ] Have I identified how my product helps people survive and thrive?
- [ ] Do I make my customers CURIOUS about my product?
- [ ] Have I ENLIGHTENED my customers as to how I can help them win?
- [ ] Have I built trust with my customers before I ask them to COMMIT?

**Additional Notes:**

### Three Reasons You Want Customers to Memorize Your Message

1. _________________________________
2. _________________________________

> **Remember:** Don't be cute or clever. Be clear.

### Message Clarity Checklist

- [ ] Can customers immediately understand what it is I offer?
- [ ] Is my message short?
- [ ] Is my message repeatable?

# MODULE 1: Write Your One-Liner

A One-Liner is a single statement you can use to help people realize why they need your product or service.

## The Formula for a Great One-Liner

### PART 1: PROBLEM
State the problem or pain point that most of your clients face.

**Things to consider:**
- Make sure the first statement is a problem and make sure it is a pain people actually feel
- Pick one problem to focus on—don't try to include every problem your customer faces
- Make sure the problem you start with is a problem that your company can actually solve

**Your Problem Statement:**

_________________________________

_________________________________

_________________________________

---

### PART 2: PRODUCT
Talk about your resolution to the problem you just stated.

**Things to consider:**
- Use your name in the solution—this associates your brand with the problem you solve
- Make sure your solution is connected to the problem you just stated
- Do not try to tell everything you do for your customer—this is a short, clear description of what service you offer

**Your Product Statement:**

_________________________________

_________________________________

_________________________________

---

### PART 3: RESULT
Show how your customer will feel and what they get after you solve their problem.

**Things to consider:**
- This should be the direct resolution to the problem you stated in part 1
- Commas are not your friend—keep it short and simple
- Focus on just one or two ways you make your customers' lives better
- Do not over-promise—any result you state should be something you are able to deliver

**Your Result Statement:**

_________________________________

_________________________________

_________________________________

---

### PUT IT ALL TOGETHER

**Things to consider:**
- Say it out loud. Does it make sense? Does it sound natural?
- Keep your one-liner simple—don't use inside language or awkward wording
- If it is hard to say, it will be hard to memorize—simplify it

**Your Complete One-Liner:**

### Example One-Liner (Circuit E-Bikes)

> "With 110 people moving to Nashville every day, people are wasting more and more time sitting in traffic. With a Circuit E-Bike fitted just for you, you'll get to work faster and add hours back to your day."

---

## How to Implement Your One-Liner

- [ ] Memorize it
- [ ] Have your entire team memorize it
- [ ] Make it your email signature
- [ ] Put it on your business card
- [ ] Make it your bio on all your social media accounts
- [ ] Make it the first sentence on your "About Us" section on your website
- [ ] Paint it on your wall in your retail space

# MODULE 2: Wireframe Your Website

Your website guides customers through the curiosity phase of the relationship.

## The Grunt Test

The header of your website should pass the "Grunt Test." A website that passes the Grunt Test answers these three questions:

1. **What do you offer?**
2. **How does it make my life better?**
3. **How do I get it?**

### Does Your Current Website Pass the Grunt Test?

| Question | Yes | No |
|----------|-----|-----|
| What do you offer? | ☐ | ☐ |
| How does it make my life better? | ☐ | ☐ |
| How do I get it? | ☐ | ☐ |

### Before Creating Your Website Wireframe, Remember:

1. People do not read websites. They scan them.
2. A picture is worth a thousand words. Use images to illustrate your services.
3. Reinforce what you offer throughout your entire website.
