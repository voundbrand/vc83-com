# Topic Collections (Consolidated)

Purpose:
- store former small top-level topic folders in one support location
- keep top-level `docs/` focused on canonical and major doc zones

Moved from top-level `docs/`:
- `REFACTORY/`
- `byok_infra/`
- `filesystem_metaphor/`
- `god_table_refactor/`
- `implementation/`
- `open-source-exploration/`
- `roadmap/`

Rule:
- prefer this location for non-canonical topic collections instead of adding new top-level folders
