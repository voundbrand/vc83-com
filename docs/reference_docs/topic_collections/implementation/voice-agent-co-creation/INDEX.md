# Voice Agent Co-Creation Index

**Workstream root:** `/Users/foundbrand_001/Development/vc83-com/docs/reference_docs/topic_collections/implementation/voice-agent-co-creation`  
**Source request:** Evolve Brain/interview into a personal, voice-first, adaptive agent co-creation experience with reusable voice runtime and clear trust controls.

---

## Purpose

This folder is the queue-first execution layer for shipping a voice-native, trust-aligned co-creation loop that:

- replaces rigid long-form interview framing with adaptive micro-sessions,
- supports explicit save/discard consent boundaries,
- adds optional voice/provider choice (including ElevenLabs), and
- reuses one voice assistant runtime across Brain and other desktop windows.
