# Desktop Appearance Consolidation Blockers

**Workstream root:** `/Users/foundbrand_001/Development/vc83-com/docs/reference_docs/topic_collections/implementation/desktop-appearance-consolidation`

---

## Logging rule

Create a blocker entry when any one is true:

- more than 15 minutes of active debugging without a viable path,
- three failed attempts on the same root issue,
- required approval prevents needed command/action,
- missing decision/requirement cannot be inferred from repository context.

When blocked:

1. Set queue status to `BLOCKED` in `TASK_QUEUE.md`.
2. Add a row in Active blockers.
3. Continue with the next `READY` task allowed by concurrency rules.
