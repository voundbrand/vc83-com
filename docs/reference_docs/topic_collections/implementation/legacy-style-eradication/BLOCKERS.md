## Open blockers

| ID | Severity | Status | Owner lane | Blocker | Evidence | Next action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `BLK-LSE-002` | `High` | `OPEN` | `A` | `LSE-002` cannot move to `DONE` because the required verify stack still fails at `npm run typecheck` on unrelated workspace typing regressions. | Latest typecheck output on 2026-02-18: `TS2589` at `src/components/window-content/media-library-window/components/left-sidebar.tsx:32` (historically also failed on `integrations-window/microsoft-settings.tsx`). | Fix or isolate current external typecheck failures, then re-run `npm run typecheck` and the full `LSE-002` verify stack. |
| `BLK-LSE-003` | `High` | `OPEN` | `B` | `LSE-003` implementation is complete in working tree, but queue gating prevents closure until `LSE-002` is `DONE`; global `V-LEGACY` still fails on baseline debt outside the row scope. | `TASK_QUEUE.md` dependency chain (`LSE-003` depends on `LSE-002`); latest verify logs on 2026-02-18 (`typecheck`/`lint`/`test:unit`/`docs:guard` pass, `ui:legacy:guard -- "$EMPTY_TREE" HEAD` fail) | Unblock/close `LSE-002`, then re-run full verify stack and promote `LSE-003` from `BLOCKED` to `DONE` once legacy guard gates are satisfied. |
| `BLK-LSE-004` | `High` | `OPEN` | `B` | `LSE-004` implementation is complete in working tree, but it depends on blocked `LSE-003` and therefore cannot move to `DONE` under queue rules; global `V-LEGACY` remains failing on baseline scoped debt. | `TASK_QUEUE.md` dependency chain (`LSE-004` depends on `LSE-003`); latest verify logs on 2026-02-18 (`typecheck`/`lint`/`test:unit`/`docs:guard` pass, `ui:legacy:guard -- "$EMPTY_TREE" HEAD` fail) | Close `LSE-002` then `LSE-003`, re-run the `LSE-004` verify stack, and promote `LSE-004` when dependency and legacy gates are satisfied. |
| `BLK-LSE-005` | `High` | `OPEN` | `C` | `LSE-005` scoped migration is complete in `integrations-window`, but queue rules block closure because dependency `LSE-004` is not `DONE`; `V-LEGACY` also fails globally on baseline debt outside Lane `C`. | `TASK_QUEUE.md` dependency chain (`LSE-005` depends on `LSE-004`); scoped regex scan on 2026-02-18 (`integrations-window` returned `0` matches for queue legacy patterns); verify logs on 2026-02-18 (`typecheck`/`lint`/`test:unit`/`docs:guard` pass, `ui:legacy:guard` fail) | Complete upstream Lane `B` gates (`LSE-002` -> `LSE-003` -> `LSE-004`) and re-run the `LSE-005` verify stack once global legacy baseline debt is reduced. |
| `BLK-LSE-006` | `High` | `OPEN` | `C` | `LSE-006` scoped migration is complete in `super-admin-organizations-window`, but row cannot move to `DONE` because it depends on blocked `LSE-005`; `V-LEGACY` remains failing globally. | `TASK_QUEUE.md` dependency chain (`LSE-006` depends on `LSE-005`); scoped regex scan on 2026-02-18 (`super-admin-organizations-window` returned `0` matches); verify logs on 2026-02-18 (`typecheck`/`lint`/`test:unit`/`docs:guard` pass, `ui:legacy:guard` fail) | Unblock/close `LSE-005`, then re-run full verify stack for `LSE-006` and promote to `DONE` when dependency and legacy gates pass. |
| `BLK-LSE-007` | `High` | `OPEN` | `C` | `LSE-007` scoped migration is complete in `web-publishing-window` and `org-owner-manage-window`, but queue gating blocks closure while `LSE-006` is blocked; `V-LEGACY` still fails globally outside Lane `C`. | `TASK_QUEUE.md` dependency chain (`LSE-007` depends on `LSE-006`); scoped regex scan on 2026-02-18 (`web-publishing-window` + `org-owner-manage-window` returned `0` matches); verify logs on 2026-02-18 (`typecheck`/`lint`/`test:unit`/`docs:guard` pass, `ui:legacy:guard` fail) | Unblock `LSE-006`, then re-run `LSE-007` verify stack and close only after dependency and global legacy guard gates pass. |
| `BLK-LSE-008` | `High` | `OPEN` | `D` | Lane `D` cannot start because prerequisite `LSE-007` is not `DONE`; verify gating also fails at `V-LEGACY` (`npm run ui:legacy:guard -- "$EMPTY_TREE" HEAD`) while baseline legacy patterns remain across guarded scope. | `docs/reference_docs/topic_collections/implementation/legacy-style-eradication/TASK_QUEUE.md` (`LSE-007` status); verify command output from 2026-02-18 showing broad scoped `--win95-`/`retro-button` residuals outside Lane `C` | Promote `LSE-007` to `DONE` after dependency gates clear, then re-attempt `LSE-008` and proceed to `LSE-009`. |
| `BLK-LSE-010` | `High` | `OPEN` | `E` | Lane `E` (`LSE-010`, `LSE-011`) cannot be completed because dependency `LSE-009` is not `DONE`, and required verify gating still fails (`typecheck` TS2589 external error + baseline `V-LEGACY` failure). | `docs/reference_docs/topic_collections/implementation/legacy-style-eradication/TASK_QUEUE.md` (`LSE-009`/`LSE-010` statuses); fresh priority-window pass on 2026-02-18 reduced `events-window`/`checkout-window`/`media-library-window`/`products-window` scoped legacy patterns to `0`, but workspace verify remains red at `src/components/window-content/media-library-window/components/left-sidebar.tsx:32` and `ui:legacy:guard -- "$EMPTY_TREE" HEAD`. | Complete `LSE-007` -> `LSE-008` -> `LSE-009`, resolve/waive external typecheck blocker, then rerun Lane `E` verify stack and promote `LSE-010`/`LSE-011`. |
| `BLK-LSE-012` | `High` | `OPEN` | `F` | Lane `F` row `LSE-012` cannot be completed because dependency `LSE-011` is still `BLOCKED` and therefore not `DONE`. A partial sweep removed `var(--win95-*)` references in shared non-window/non-builder components and cleared `convex`, but broad residual legacy usage remains in guarded `window-content`/`globals`/`app/page` scope and `V-LEGACY` still fails. | `/Users/foundbrand_001/Development/vc83-com/docs/reference_docs/topic_collections/implementation/legacy-style-eradication/TASK_QUEUE.md` (`LSE-011` status); `/Users/foundbrand_001/Development/vc83-com/tmp/reports/legacy-style-lse012-lanef-residual.txt`; `npm run ui:legacy:guard -- "$EMPTY_TREE" HEAD` output from 2026-02-18 | Complete and verify `LSE-010` + `LSE-011`, then resume `LSE-012` to clear remaining `retro-button`/`zinc-*`/`purple-*` references and re-run full verify stack. |
| `BLK-LSE-013` | `High` | `OPEN` | `G` | Lane `G` cannot close because dependency `LSE-012` is not `DONE`, baseline `V-LEGACY` still fails on broad scoped debt, and `V-TYPE` is still red in this workspace. | `TASK_QUEUE.md` (`LSE-012`, `LSE-013`, `LSE-014` statuses); fresh reports `/Users/foundbrand_001/Development/vc83-com/tmp/reports/legacy-style-full-project-current.txt` (`3913` matches, `274` files) and `/Users/foundbrand_001/Development/vc83-com/tmp/reports/legacy-style-full-project-after-edits.txt` (`2955` matches, `244` files); verify outputs: `npm run typecheck` fails at `media-library-window/components/left-sidebar.tsx:32`, `npm run ui:legacy:guard -- "$EMPTY_TREE" HEAD` fails. | Complete and verify `LSE-010`/`LSE-011`/`LSE-012`, then re-run full `LSE-013` verify stack and promote `LSE-014` only when all gates pass. |

## Cleared blockers

| ID | Cleared on | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| `BLK-LSE-001` | 2026-02-18 | `LSE-001` replaced dynamic `awk` regex matching with BSD/macOS-safe matching logic; baseline guard now runs without parser errors and reports true legacy violations. |
