# Agent Trust Experience Task Queue

**Last updated:** 2026-02-19  
**Workstream root:** `/Users/foundbrand_001/Development/vc83-com/docs/reference_docs/topic_collections/implementation/agent-trust-experience`  
**Source request:** Bird's-eye + deep implementation plan for Brain window, trust interview, Pressmaster memory docs, and AI Agents UI to deliver AI trust.

---

## Queue rules

1. Allowed statuses are only: `READY`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `PENDING`, `BLOCKED`, `DONE`.
2. Only one task may be `IN_PROGRESS` globally unless concurrency rules explicitly allow one per lane.
3. Promote a task from `PENDING` to `READY` only when all dependencies are `DONE`.
4. Selection order is deterministic: highest priority (`P0` -> `P1` -> `P2`) then lowest task ID.
5. If a task is `BLOCKED`, capture blocker details in row `Notes` and continue with next `READY` task.
6. Every task must include explicit verification commands before moving to `DONE`.
7. Keep lane boundaries strict to reduce merge conflicts.
8. Sync `INDEX.md`, `MASTER_PLAN.md`, and `TASK_QUEUE.md` after each completed task.

Verify run: `V-LINT` passed with existing warnings, `V-UNIT` passed, `V-TYPE` failed on pre-existing `src/components/window-content/org-owner-manage-window/security-tab.tsx:44` (`TS2589`). |
| `ATX-004` | `B` | 2 | `P0` | `DONE` | `ATX-002` | Replace Brain Review mock data with real org-scoped query pipeline and category/search filtering | `src/components/window-content/brain-window/review-mode.tsx`; supporting Convex query modules | `V-TYPE`; `V-LINT`; `V-BRAIN-LINT` | Done 2026-02-17: removed `MOCK_KNOWLEDGE_ITEMS`, added org-scoped `convex/brainKnowledge.ts` query, server-side category/search filtering, and explicit loading/empty/error states with retry and source attribution. Risk checks before completion: prevent cross-org data leakage, preserve explicit loading/empty/error visibility, and keep source attribution on surfaced knowledge rows. Verify: `V-LINT` and `V-BRAIN-LINT` passed with existing warnings; `V-TYPE` failed on pre-existing non-lane issues in `src/app/api/native-guest/config/route.ts` and missing `ai-chat-window` imports in `src/app/chat/page.tsx`, `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/hooks/window-registry.tsx`. |

Risk checks before completion: prevent fallback-to-simulation ingestion paths, persist explicit failure reasons for every failed source, and enforce org-scoped authorization on all ingestion writes. Verify: `V-LINT`, `V-BRAIN-LINT`, and `V-UNIT` passed (existing warnings only); `V-TYPE` failed on pre-existing deep type issue in `src/hooks/use-ai-chat.ts:450`. |

Risk checks before completion: no pre-consent memory writes, decline/revoke removes durable memory, source attribution remains visible at consent decision. Verify: `V-TYPE`, `V-LINT`, `V-BRAIN-LINT`, and `V-UNIT` all passed (lint profiles warnings only). |
| `ATX-007` | `C` | 3 | `P0` | `DONE` | `ATX-002` | Create soul-building interview template set for: customer agent, agent team shape, and super-admin platform agent training | `convex/seeds/interviewTemplates.ts`; `convex/interviewTemplateOntology.ts`; related docs | `V-TYPE`; `V-LINT`; `V-BRAIN-LINT` | Done 2026-02-17: replaced default seeds with trust-first template set (`Customer Agent Identity Blueprint`, `Agent Team Shape Charter`, `Platform Agent Trust Training`) with explicit identity anchors, guardrails, handoff boundaries, and drift cues in phase prompts + output schema fields. Risk checks before completion: preserve trust-boundary coverage across all templates, keep one deterministic template per mode, and maintain platform-training parity. Verify: `V-LINT` and `V-BRAIN-LINT` passed with existing warnings; initial `V-TYPE` run failed on non-lane `convex/ai/teamHarness.ts:182` type mismatch. |
| `ATX-008` | `C` | 3 | `P1` | `DONE` | `ATX-007`, `ATX-006` | Add trust artifacts from interview outputs (Soul Card, Guardrails Card, Team Charter, Memory Ledger) and render hooks | `convex/ai/interviewRunner.ts`; `src/components/interview/interview-results.tsx`; Brain review integrations | `V-TYPE`; `V-LINT`; `V-UNIT` | Done 2026-02-17: interview completion now persists shared trust artifact bundle (`trust-artifacts.v1`) with source-attributed entries for identity anchors, guardrails, handoff boundaries, and drift cues; `interview-results.tsx` renders artifact cards + memory ledger entries and export payload includes artifacts; Brain review summaries now surface trust artifact coverage/cue counts for Content DNA records. Risk checks before completion: prevent artifact misclassification from dropping safety boundaries, keep legacy result rendering compatible, and ensure Brain review exposes handoff/drift cues. Verify: `V-TYPE` passed after TS2589-safe query cast update in `interview-results.tsx`; `V-LINT` passed with existing warnings; `V-UNIT` passed (`45` files, `243` tests). |

Risk checks before completion: prevent setup output from being discarded by page-schema parsing, prevent empty/non-guided setup entry state, and prevent setup mode from running on the wrong provider. Verify: `V-TYPE` passed; `V-LINT` and `V-SETUP-LINT` passed with existing warnings only; `V-UNIT` passed. |

Added agent linking support in `builderAppOntology.linkObjectsToBuilderApp` and existing-agent matching in `getExistingRecordsForConnection`. Risk checks before completion: block invalid/missing `agent-config.json` with actionable validation output, ensure KB docs become durable knowledge artifacts (not dropped), and keep no-KB fallback deterministic with warning feedback. Verify: re-ran `V-TYPE`, `V-LINT`, `V-SETUP-LINT`, and `V-UNIT`; all passed (lint profiles with existing warnings only). |

Updated approvals queue to summarize intent/context instead of raw payload dumps while preserving approve/reject actions. Risk checks before completion: preserve approval/escalation action semantics, ensure timeline emphasizes “what changed + why + what to do next”, and avoid guardrail/drift context loss in operator view. Verify: `V-TYPE` passed; `V-LINT` passed with existing warnings (`0` errors, `2922` warnings); `V-AGENTS-LINT` passed with existing warnings (`0` errors, `77` warnings); `V-UNIT` passed (`54` files, `278` tests). |

## Current kickoff

- Active task: none.
- Next task to execute: none (lane `I` complete).
- Immediate objective: maintain lane `I` closeout state and monitor verify baseline regressions outside lane scope.
