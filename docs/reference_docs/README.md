# Reference Docs (Canonical Support Folder)

Purpose:
- hold migrated root-level implementation and handoff docs that are still referenced
- keep active links stable while reducing `docs/` root sprawl
- separate supporting references from core architecture docs

Primary canonical architecture docs remain in:
- `docs/platform/`
- `docs/ai-endurance/`

Consolidated topic folders:
- `docs/reference_docs/single_topic_folders/` contains former one-file top-level topic folders
- `docs/reference_docs/topic_collections/` contains former small multi-file top-level topic folders

Primary implementation buckets:
- `docs/reference_docs/api/` API and platform integration references
- `docs/reference_docs/frontend/` frontend integration and UX references
- `docs/reference_docs/billing/` billing, tax, and provider architecture references

Archive snapshot of migrated root references:
- `docs/archive/root-md-referenced-migrated-2026-02-16/`

Rule:
- do not add new docs to `docs/` root; place supporting references here or archive them
