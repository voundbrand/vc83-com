The worldwide SAS market is about $300
0:02
billion uh per year. The labor market in
0:06
the US alone is 13 trillion. What
0:08
software is now going after, the prize
0:10
that it's going after is the labor
0:13
market. Almost every software company
0:15
has basically taken a filing cabinet and
0:18
turned it into a database. But what's
0:20
happening now is the whole thing is
0:21
effectively done endto end.
Historical Context: Automation and Labor
0:27
I'm going to talk about how software
0:28
eats labor. Um and uh you know first
0:31
Mark wrote an essay for the Wall Street
0:33
Journal a long time ago about 10 years
0:35
ago about how software eats the world. I
0:37
guess the labor labor force falls within
0:39
the world. So this is a natural
0:41
follow-up. But if there's only one
0:43
takeaway that I can leave with with you
0:45
today is that the labor market this is
0:47
almost obvious is so much bigger than
0:49
the software market. So the worldwide
0:51
SAS market is about $300 billion uh per
0:55
year. Uh worldwide market cap is about
0:57
$2.2 $2 trillion. The labor market in
1:00
the US alone is 13 trillion. So much
1:03
much bigger. And it doesn't mean that
1:05
the software market will suddenly be
1:06
worth $13 trillion a year. But what
1:09
software is now going after, the prize
1:11
that it's going after is the labor
1:13
market. And I figured there's nothing
1:15
better than starting a venture capital
1:16
conference with a picture of the world's
1:18
most famous communist. That's Karl Marx
1:20
right there. And if if you've read Dos
1:22
Capitol, which which I read back at
1:24
college, um if if you remember like the
1:26
the central tenant is that there's
1:28
capital and labor and capital exploits
1:30
labor. They're they're two distinct
1:32
things. But uh what's really exciting,
1:34
this is almost like a chemical equation
1:36
is that the capital that you give us, we
1:39
give to companies. What do the companies
1:40
do with the capital? They buy GPUs or
1:43
rent them. They hire engineers. They buy
1:45
coffee. They give coffee and GPUs to the
1:48
engineers. And then out pops software
1:51
that does the job of labor. And and this
1:53
is it's like the new E= MCÂ². And we're
1:56
seeing this happen at so many companies.
1:58
And these companies are scaling so
1:59
quickly because they really are selling
2:02
into clients or you know end users and
2:04
saying, "Hey, we'll do this job for you.
2:06
We're not giving you software. We're
2:08
going to do a job for you." And that
2:09
that's the sales pitch. Um and obviously
2:12
like this concept is not new per se. I
2:15
mean like uh automation has been around
2:18
for a long time. So you know
2:19
seamstresses you know here here's a you
2:22
know a picture from I don't know
2:23
probably the 1600s or 1700s. The loom
2:26
replaced those jobs but you still had
2:29
somebody that had to operate the loom.
2:31
Um or steam ships. You know there there
2:34
were no iPhones back then. So I don't
2:35
actually have have a picture of Roman
2:37
Orsman but they probably look like this.
2:39
And sailboats and steam ships obviously
2:41
made that form of labor much more
2:43
efficient. But you still need somebody
2:44
to operate and you know shovel coal into
2:46
the steam ship and put the sails up on
2:49
the mast. Um and then of course the the
2:51
printing press invented by Gutenberg
2:53
like that was a big innovation. Um and
2:55
the steam powered press allowed you know
2:57
the LA Times to print out hundreds of
2:59
thousands of copies of that newspaper
3:01
versus somebody you know manually
3:02
cranking one each time. And uh and you
3:04
know lastly like the assembly line was a
3:06
massive innovation in terms of replacing
3:08
people that hand assembled every gizmo
3:11
and now you have an assembly line but
3:12
you know a lot of people worked on the
3:13
assembly line. So again this concept is
3:15
not new like you could always take
3:17
capital make a machine and then have
3:20
more efficient labor on the other side
3:22
but what's happening now is the whole
3:23
thing is effectively done end to end and
The Filing Cabinet Era: Digitizing Records
3:25
I I want to take you through a journey
3:27
of what the software market has always
3:29
been because I think understanding the
3:31
past is the best window of actually
3:33
understanding the future and what's
3:34
possible. So my my thesis is that almost
3:38
every software company has basically
3:40
taken a filing cabinet and turned it
3:42
into a database. And this is where the
3:45
$2.2 trillion of market cap has come
3:47
from. This is where the $300 billion in
3:49
annual software revenue has come from.
3:51
And the first example that I'd like to
3:52
point to is a company called Saber
3:54
Systems. Um this is with two A's. if
3:56
you've seen it. It's a company in Texas,
3:58
but this was a joint project of American
4:00
Airlines and IBM back when IBM was the
4:03
the most powerful uh computer company in
4:06
the world, technology company in the
4:07
world because uh at least according to
4:09
chat GPT, I asked for some graphical
4:11
help here. Like what would it have
Case Studies: Software Transforming Industries
4:13
looked like to book an airline ticket in
4:15
1959? Like what how did American
4:17
Airlines handle this? They probably had
4:19
like lots of filing cabinets with like
4:22
sheets like this. So Betty Owens calls
4:24
up and says, "I want to sit in four. I
4:26
want to sit in seat 4 A." Talks to
4:28
somebody on the phone. Oh, wait. No,
4:30
actually I want to cancel my flight.
4:31
They have to erase it. No, actually I
4:32
want to seat I want to sit in seat 2C.
4:34
Erase that again. You know, filing
4:36
cabinets basically kept track of
4:38
everything. It was pretty inefficient.
4:40
You had a lot of people that worked the
4:41
filing cabinets. You couldn't share
4:42
information from one office to another
4:44
because everything was doiciled in one
4:45
filing cabinet. Um, and Saber changed
4:48
the game by putting it all on an IBM
4:50
mainframe and then having lots of kind
4:52
of thin client terminals that were used
4:54
by travel agents around the world that
4:55
could access that mainframe. And this is
4:58
how travel was uh revolutionized. Uh,
5:00
Galileo did this for hotels. Amadeas did
5:03
this for Europe. I mean like big
5:05
companies came out of this. Um, and of
5:07
course the same process happened for
5:09
sales. So I think somebody yesterday
5:10
mentioned Glengary, Glenn Ross, great
5:12
movie. But if you remember there were
5:13
lots of business cards. You wanted to
5:15
get the Glengary leads. Those were the
5:16
good leads. Those were pieces of paper.
5:19
Um, and uh, for for those of you that
5:21
are old like me, you might remember a
5:22
company called Axe Systems in the 1980s.
5:24
This was one of the big CRM companies of
5:27
the day. Gold mine followed that in 1990
5:30
and then Tom Seville started Sevil
5:32
Systems in 1993. But all of these took
5:33
the filing cabinets of sales, you know,
5:36
put them originally in uh, kind of
5:38
mainframes and then Salesforce came in
5:40
in 1999, put that in the cloud. But you
5:42
know, again, the same salesperson that
5:44
accessed the physical file in a
5:46
fictional movie set in the 1950s would
5:48
now access a Salesforce record in 2010.
5:51
Same process, just different medium. Um,
5:54
manufacturing and inventory. This is
5:55
another big one. So, imagine that you're
5:56
a product manufacturer. How many widgets
5:58
do I own? You know, what's my inventory?
6:01
What's my sales? IBM again at the
6:03
forefront of this. But other companies,
6:04
you know, some that are around today
6:05
like SAP started in 1972. Bond, JD
6:09
Edwards, Epicor, Sage, I2, these are all
6:12
big companies that basically digitized
6:14
old-fashioned records. Um, my favorite
6:17
one just to show how pervasive this idea
6:19
is, is there was actually a big business
6:21
in library card cataloges. So, libraries
6:23
were have been around for a very, very
6:25
long time. You know, Library of
6:26
Alexandria, right? Like long long time.
6:28
um the Dewey decibel system comes out
6:30
and you know when I was growing up I'd
6:32
go to like the card catalog and figure
6:34
out okay they're all alphabetically
6:35
sorted and then eventually somebody
6:37
created started with this company called
6:39
OLC um built a you know reasonably sized
6:42
business and sort of innovative Cersei
6:44
Dynx of digitizing those card cataloges
6:47
where now you enter into a terminal at
6:49
the computer uh in the library and then
6:51
you figure out where your book is is it
6:52
in stock um legal case files you know
6:56
like every time I went to a law firm in
6:58
1980s it's like most of the square
7:00
footage was filing cabinets and
7:02
companies like PC Law like a lot of
7:04
Lexus Nexus and Reuters revenue comes
7:06
from you know selling to law firms
7:08
digitizing things that would otherwise
7:10
occupy so much square footage in the
7:12
nice you know Fifth Avenue uh you know
7:14
offices of of law firms
7:17
were accountants growing up and I
7:19
remember going to their office and again
7:21
there there was no room for a little
7:22
5-year-old to run around because all
7:24
filing cabinets you know into it comes
7:26
along with QuickBooks digitiz ized um
7:29
financial statements. Um Peach Tree,
7:31
this is a company from the 1970s, MYOB,
7:33
like lots of companies. Again, filing
7:34
cabinets, filing cabinets. You you get
7:36
the uh the drill here. U my my favorite
7:39
name in the history of software is
7:40
filing cabinets. The first electronic
7:42
health records company was a company
7:44
called Mumps, which arguably is the
7:46
worst name in the history of software.
7:48
It like somehow lost out to malaria or
7:50
measles or something, but this was Mass
7:52
General Hospital. um and they wanted to
7:54
replace their filing cabinets and they
7:56
came up with this programming language
7:58
and database system called Mums. But
8:00
Epic and Cerner, Epic is the biggest
8:01
electronic health records company in the
8:03
world. It was started in 1979. Um so
8:06
again and what they did was just
8:08
digitize these massive number of files
8:10
that every hospital system and doctor
8:12
would have in their office. And kind of
8:14
lastly here uh HR and payroll. So
8:16
actually even before Saber uh automated
8:18
data processing ADP was started in 1949.
8:20
How do you keep track of time and
8:22
attendance? You know, you had your time
8:23
slip, your time cards. How do I figure
8:25
out tax withholding? All of these
8:27
companies came out and the again the
8:29
progression was I take the file, I put
8:31
it in a mainframe and then companies
8:33
like you know workday was effectively
8:35
Peopleoft. It was the same team that
8:36
started Peopleoft. They put it in the
8:38
cloud. But the same process was there.
The SaaS Business Model and Its Limits
8:40
The people that looked at your time and
8:42
attendance slip in 1940 were the same
8:43
people that looked at it in 2015. But
8:45
now the medium was not paper. It was not
8:47
mainframe. It was cloud. And the reason
8:49
why I mention all of this is because
8:52
nothing has actually gotten that much
8:54
more efficient because the filing
8:55
cabinets were read by humans. The
8:57
digital records are read by humans,
8:59
right? It's like this woman here,
9:01
whatever she's doing, looking at, you
9:02
know, help helping a customer with
9:04
customer support needs or something.
9:05
Once upon a time would have looked at a
9:07
piece of paper, now is looking at a
9:09
computer. And the reason why this is so
9:12
important to understand is because the
9:14
whole business model of software has to
9:17
change. It has to change. Um, this is
9:19
what I call to as a as homage to to
9:22
Starbucks here the the tall grande venty
9:25
model of SAS. Like if you go to any SAS
9:27
company in the world, you go to their
9:29
landing page, it probably looks like
9:30
this. This is a company called Zenesk.
9:32
It's now a private company. It was taken
9:34
private by Premier and Helman Freeman a
9:36
few years ago. Um, and this is a $2
9:38
billion ARR company that sells seats.
9:41
So, you know, their most popular like
9:43
the the Venty package is you get the
9:45
sweet professional $115 a month. But,
9:48
you know, we've talked about in the last
9:50
couple days how now AI does a really
9:52
good job answering customer support
9:54
queries. So, how many seats do you need
9:57
if every one of your agents is 9,000
10:00
times more productive? Imagine that you
10:01
have a thousand seats. And I I drew this
10:03
out for you so you could see it. Like,
10:04
imagine that I've got a,000 people
10:06
working in my customer support call
10:07
center. I pay each one fully loaded
10:10
$75,000 a year. So that's $75 million a
10:13
year in cost for people. Well, what's my
10:15
software cost? Well, it's a a,000 time
10:18
115* 12. It's about $1.4 million a year
10:22
for the software. So the people cost is
10:23
so much higher than the software cost.
10:26
And this could go one of two directions
10:28
for a company like Zenesk. If it turns
10:30
out that AI can answer all the
10:31
questions, how many seats do you need?
10:33
Zero. You don't need a single seat left.
10:36
the AI answers everything and then
10:38
Zenesk is charging per seat. So they
10:39
would go from 1.4 million to zero
10:42
dollars in revenue. That would be very
10:43
bad. On the other hand, I mean, look
10:45
look at the math here. Like if if each
10:46
human is answering 2,000 questions a
10:48
year, right now your fully loaded cost
10:52
as the the company that uses Zenesk as
10:54
your system of record for answering
10:56
customer support. It's about $37 of of
11:00
human cost and 69 cents of software
11:02
cost. Like the cost per answer is $38.
11:05
And this is, you know, rough rough uh
11:07
company example. Um maybe Zenesk could
11:10
charge $5 million a year. Like I, hey,
11:12
don't spend $75 million a year on
11:14
support anymore. Spend $5 million a year
11:16
on support. Just pay it all to us. Don't
11:18
pay us 1.4 million. Pay us 5 million.
11:20
Save75. And so Zenesk is really at the
11:23
precipice of it's like their revenue
11:24
could go to zero or their revenue could
11:26
3x. And like where's it going to go? I I
11:29
don't know the answer. They don't know
11:30
the answer. I've been talking to their
11:31
CEO. are piloting outcomebased pricing
11:34
in New Zealand right now. So New Zealand
11:36
holds the answer to all of our
11:37
questions. So uh stay tuned.
11:40
And um you know just to give again
Labor Market Scale vs. Software Market
11:42
another example of just how much bigger
11:45
these labor or quasi labor markets are
11:47
like the $13 trillion of wages that we
11:50
talked about um you know software
11:52
revenue is very small. If you just take
11:53
one category like just just one
11:55
particular profession and take the
11:57
example of nurses just because we have a
11:58
portfolio company in this space um
12:00
nurses in the United States of America
12:02
earn about $650 billion a year. There
12:04
about four and a half million registered
12:06
nurses. That's bigger than the entire
12:08
worldwide software market. And it
12:09
doesn't mean that software will take
12:11
like the the nursing software market
12:13
will be this big. But it means like this
12:15
is the pool that you're really playing
12:17
against.
The Shift: Software Doing the Job
12:19
And the reason why I wanted to start
12:20
with the filing cabinets is like this is
12:22
going to start moving to outcomes. Like
12:24
the the the software is going to go from
12:26
being the filing cabinet to effectively
12:28
operating on the filing cabinet. And
12:30
what does that mean? Well, you know,
12:32
take the first example. If I have the
12:34
filing cabinet for travel, you know,
12:36
maybe the software can rebook flights or
12:38
I want to book a trip for 75 kids at my
12:41
my son's high school and need to talk to
12:42
an agent. I don't need to talk to an
12:44
agent anymore. I just talk to the
12:45
software company. I talk directly to
12:48
United Airlines, you know, AI and they
12:50
do the entire thing for me. Sales, I
12:52
mean, this is kind of obvious. You know,
12:54
Salesforce charges per seat per month.
12:56
Salesforce should just sell for me. I
12:58
don't want to pay for a thousand seats.
13:00
I want to pay for customers. Like, hey,
13:02
go go go get me customers because you're
13:04
the backend for that anyway. Or survey
13:06
all of my customers. Do a 30-minute
13:07
phone call with every single one of
13:08
them. See how they're doing. Are they
13:10
happy? Are they going to re renew with
13:11
me? Yes or no? You know what about
13:13
manufacturing? Well, imagine that I make
13:15
widgets and there are these things
13:17
called tariffs that are happening. I'd
13:18
love to figure out what my tariff
13:20
exposure is. Let me just ask my ERP
13:22
system, research that for me. Um, or I
13:25
want you to do an audit or call my
13:27
suppliers and see if they're going to
13:29
still be able to to to ship me their
13:31
things on time. Uh, library card
13:33
cataloges, as crazy as this one is, you
13:35
know what? If my book is overdue, the
13:37
librarian shouldn't be calling me. the
13:38
library card software company should be
13:40
calling me saying, "Hey buddy, return
13:42
the book or order more books because
13:43
this one's very popular." You know, Ben
13:45
Ben's book is selling out. Order more
13:47
copies of that. Um, legal case files,
13:49
like a lot of software companies that
13:50
are popping up in this space. It's no
13:52
longer the system of record for like
13:54
time and attendance. Like, draft me a
13:55
contract. Like, do that work for me. You
13:58
could start billing out. Again, unclear
14:00
how the pricing model of this is going
14:02
to work, but start billing for that. Um,
14:04
accounting and bookkeeping. Um, you
14:06
know, AR aging summary, like this
14:08
concept has been around for a long time.
14:10
I have a lot of companies that owe me a
14:11
money, a lot of clients that owe me
14:12
money. Um, in 1940, I'd look at the
14:15
printout and say, I'm going to call
14:16
these customers and hopefully collect
14:18
for them or send the guy with the
14:19
crowbar or do something. In 2000, I'd
14:22
look at the QuickBooks thing and do the
14:24
same thing. Now, the software company
14:26
can go call like QuickBooks is going to
14:28
start calling customers uh of of their
14:31
clients and say, "Hey, you you owe me
14:33
money. please pay me back and I I can
14:34
accept a payment on the phone right now.
14:36
Um, health records. So, if you saw me
14:38
limp off stage, I sadly had Achilles
14:40
repair surgery about three months ago. I
14:42
don't recommend it. Uh, the day after my
14:44
surgery, I got a call from Stanford
14:45
Hospital saying, you know, Alex, on a
14:47
scale of 1 to 10, what's your pain
14:48
level? And I said, 11. And they said,
14:50
very funny. And I said, no, it really is
14:52
11. Um, and uh, an AI nurse can't do
14:56
CPR, right? An AI nurse can't attend to
14:58
a gunshot wound victim, but an AI nurse
15:00
can totally call a mid-40s patient like
15:03
me and say, "How are you doing? Is there
15:05
anything we can help with?" You know,
15:06
"Do you have a fever? Oh, you do? You
15:08
should go to the hospital right now."
15:10
And stuff like that. And again, these
15:12
are the outcomes. These are the
15:13
operations that can be performed on if
15:16
you have my medical record, that's what
15:17
you do with it. And charge for that.
15:19
Charge $20 for that outbound call. Um,
15:21
HR and payroll. How do I do a reference
15:23
check? How how do I make sure that you
15:25
on your resume you said you worked at
15:26
these three companies? You know what?
15:28
Workday should call those three
15:29
companies and say, "Did Alex really work
15:31
there?" Um explain benefits, help with
15:34
enrollment. Workday could probably
15:35
triple their revenue if they start doing
15:38
this because they're already the system
15:39
of record. So, um if you know the story
15:41
of Airbnb, uh Airbnb famously started by
Case Study: Job Opening
15:45
somewhat scraping Craigslist. Craigslist
15:47
is this horrible site from the mid90s
15:48
that has not changed since the mid '90s.
15:50
And they have lots of listings for
15:52
apartments. and you go look at an
15:53
apartment and like half the time it's a
15:55
scam, half the time it's already been
15:56
booked or you know it's been relisted
15:58
every single day and they basically put
16:00
them in a better interface and called it
16:02
uh Airbnb and that's how they got
16:03
started. And this is one of the most
16:05
exciting things that we're seeing, which
16:07
is here's a real ad on Craigslist.
16:09
Because since I have so much copious
16:11
time due to my set Achilles injury, I I
16:13
used to run every day, a bike every day.
16:14
I can't do that anymore. So I hang out
16:15
on Craigslist looking for jobs. Not for
16:17
myself, of course. Uh and uh here's a
16:20
job for Plaza Lane Optometry. They're
16:23
hiring a front desk receptionist and
16:25
they've had this job opening for 6
16:27
months. It's been hanging out there for
16:29
6 months. the uh job pro like you have
16:31
to now say in California how much you're
16:33
char how much you're going to pay it's
16:34
$45,000 a year so supply and demand if
16:36
they probably said we're going to pay
16:37
$100,000 a year they would have filled
16:39
this job they're paying they need to pay
16:40
$45,000 a year to make this work within
16:42
their cost model or something if you
16:44
look at the job responsibilities if you
16:46
can read this like the first one is like
16:48
open and close the shop lock the door AI
16:50
can't do that but a lot of the other job
16:52
responsibilities AI can completely do
16:54
it's you know argue with insurance
16:56
company call patient the day before
16:58
their appointment to prevent no-shows.
17:00
If somebody doesn't show up, that's a
17:02
big that's a big opportunity cost for
17:03
the optometrist.
17:05
And if you were to look at the optometry
17:07
market and say, is that a good software
17:09
market? You would say categorically no.
17:12
Because Plaza optometry probably spends
17:14
$500 a year on software. They probably
17:16
have a Microsoft Office license. Uh they
17:19
probably have a website with Squarespace
17:21
or Wix and that's it. So they probably
17:22
spend $500 a year. So, in this new
17:25
world, and again, we're seeing a lot of
17:26
companies doing this. They peruse
17:28
Craigslist. They look for a job listing
17:30
and they're like, "Hey, Plaza Lane
17:31
Optometry, I want to apply for the job."
17:33
And you know, the optometry is like,
17:34
"Okay, that sounds great. Tell me about
17:35
your qualifications. Where did you work
17:36
before?" It's like, "I know this sounds
17:38
crazy, but I'm a software company and I
17:41
can I can't close the doors and do this,
17:43
but I can do these other eight things.
17:44
Can I give you a demo?" And at first,
17:45
the optometrist is like, "No, I want to
17:47
Oh, okay. I'll try it out." And by the
17:49
way, it's $20,000 a year, which is much
17:51
less than the $45,000 a year that you
17:53
were going to pay for a human that you
17:54
can't even hire. So this is happening
17:57
right now and it's incredible. And
17:59
again, like the software spend small for
18:02
these people, the effective labor spend
18:04
much much higher. And and this is what's
18:07
massively growing the market for a lot
18:09
of these obscure industries. So I just
Real-World Examples: AI in Action
18:11
thought uh rather than me talk, I want
18:13
to give you an example. Um, this is one
18:15
of our portfolio companies, Happy Robot,
18:17
which serves the uh the freight and uh
18:19
and trucking space. So, so listen, this
18:21
is a a negotiation on the phone
18:23
conducted with a prospective client and
18:25
AI,
18:27
Illinois.
18:28
All right. So, this is Juliet, Illinois
18:30
to today between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m.
18:32
Delivers Monday between 6 a.m. and 4
18:34
p.m. I have 700 on this one. Would you
18:37
like to book this load? See?
18:39
Um, I'm going to need 800 for this one.
18:42
I can check on that.
18:44
So, um, we can't do eight at this point.
18:46
Any chance you could come a bit closer
18:47
to the loadboard rate?
18:49
I could I could do a 775.
18:52
That's really my lowest.
18:54
I understand. So, um, no chance you
18:56
could do any better than 775.
19:00
Um, how about 750?
19:03
Let me see.
19:06
Okay, I was able to get you 735 here.
19:10
735. Okay.
19:14
So that that's a closed transaction. Who
19:16
who's the robot and who's the human?
19:17
This is like the new touring test. I'll
19:19
let you guys quiz me afterwards on that
19:21
with with your own theories. Here's
19:22
another example. Um this is a company
19:24
called Salient that does collections. So
19:26
if you have if you're a lender, if
19:28
you're an auto lender, um you know, you
19:32
have to collect loan, you have to
19:33
collect uh re repayments on your loans.
19:35
And Salant serves a lot of auto lenders
19:37
in this country. And here's here's
19:39
another call from them. Currently, your
19:40
account is 51 days past due for $825.35.
19:45
Would you be able to make a payment
19:46
today?
19:59
So the cool thing there is that Salant
20:02
speaks dozens of languages. So it speaks
20:05
Tagalog, it speaks Vietnamese, Mandarin,
20:07
and again like this is a really
20:10
important point. It's not just about
20:12
cost. Um cost like this is where people
20:15
are getting this wrong. It's not like oh
20:16
AI is going to take all the jobs because
20:17
humans are too expensive and AI is
20:19
cheaper. AI does a bunch of things like
20:22
intermittent demand is a big one. Um,
20:24
imagine that I'm Black Friday retail.
20:27
I'm a retailer and people know that, you
20:29
know, sales are much higher around Black
20:31
Friday. So, I would have to hire tons of
20:33
cashiers or if I'm an online retailer,
20:36
hire lots of customer support people to
20:38
go answer queries and whatnot and then
20:40
what do I do on January 1st? Do I fire
20:43
them all and then rehire them in
20:45
November? But actually, I should
20:46
probably hire them in September because
20:47
I have to train them. Kind of tricky.
20:49
And there are a lot of other industries
20:51
that have intermittent demand issues. I
20:53
mean, United Airlines, if they have bad
20:55
weather over Chicago, which of course
20:56
never happens, they can't just hire and
20:59
train 10,000 people overnight, but
The Human Element: Demoralizing Jobs & Language
21:01
again, AI very, very good at that. The
21:03
other example is there there are a lot
21:05
of demoralizing jobs out there. What is
21:07
a demoralizing job? Well, collections is
21:10
kind of a demoralizing job because you
21:11
go call people and say, "Hey, you're
21:12
overdue." About half the time, and I've
21:15
listened to some of these calls, there
21:17
are lots of expletives on the on the
21:19
other side, right? So, it's like, "Hey,
21:20
you owe me money." It's like, "F you,
21:21
you never call me again." and it's like
21:22
h call back again hey you owe me money f
21:24
you never call me again a human would
21:26
get kind of tired of that it's not a fun
21:28
job um AI doesn't get bothered so again
21:31
demoralizing jobs very very good
21:33
regulatory certainty so go back to this
21:35
um you know I co-ounded a company called
21:37
the firm um we got trained every quarter
21:40
on UDAP unfair defect sorry unfair
21:43
deceptive and abusive practices so there
21:45
are lots of laws that mandate what you
21:47
can and can't say to a customer so
21:49
imagine that you're calling a customer
21:50
say hey you owe me money the customer
21:52
says, "F you." And then you have
21:54
somebody on the other end who's had a
21:55
kind of a bad day and you can't blame
21:56
them. It's like, "F you back, customer."
21:59
They're going to get in trouble for
22:00
that, right? And you have more certainty
22:03
when you can program effectively a robot
22:05
to conduct the entire call end to end
22:07
much more so than people. And my my
22:10
favorite example here is somebody who
22:11
studied, you know, too I I I speak
22:13
Russian, Japanese, and a smattering of
22:15
Spanish and and spent way too much time
22:16
learning that stuff. Languages,
22:18
languages, languages. I mean, it's just
22:20
fact that a nurse, an AI nurse, like
22:22
what if I only spoke Farsy? Does
22:24
Stanford have any Farsy speaking nurses
22:27
that can call me about my pain level?
22:28
What if I only spoke Mongolian? Like,
22:30
now they do. An AI nurse, an AI
22:33
collections agent, an AI negotiator.
22:35
Like, all of these things can be done in
22:37
dozens of different languages instantly.
22:39
And you just wouldn't hire a human for
22:41
that. can't get somebody in Iowa that
22:43
speaks Serbian um on demand
22:45
intermittently with a demoralizing job
22:47
and so on and so forth. You know, AI
22:49
does great. Um and and it's also very
22:51
important that AI expands the market and
Market Expansion: New Opportunities with AI
22:52
this is why I wanted to start with the
22:54
story of filing cabinets because there
22:56
was no software company for compliance
22:59
because uh this is actually a fact from
23:00
the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The
23:02
fastest growing job in America is
23:04
manicurist pedicurist. AI can't do that.
23:07
Uh the second fact fastest is compliance
23:10
officer. So compliance officer uh you
23:13
don't need software for compliance
23:14
officers. If you're a city bank, you
23:16
need more people. Um and no company has
23:19
popped up effectively doing software
23:21
because it's like the software market's
23:23
kind of small. The people market's very
23:25
large. Now you can roll into city and
23:28
say, "Hey, I will do compliance for you
23:30
endtoend as a software solution. Pay me
23:33
$10 million a year and I'm your software
23:35
product that kind of tracks everything."
23:37
Because before they would just h they
23:38
would just get more Microsoft Office
23:40
licenses or collections like there is no
23:42
software company for collections. There
23:43
are collections people at collections
23:45
firms. Now you can actually enter
23:48
potentially with the wedge of voice and
23:49
this is going to get commoditized
23:51
quickly and we realize this. But you can
23:53
backfill into a software company with
23:55
real software revenue, real software
23:57
margins, real software retention. Um,
23:59
the other thing that you're going to
24:00
start seeing us do is there are a lot of
24:03
nonAI companies that now work because of
24:06
AI. So, because of my said very sad
24:09
injury, I'm I'm a big cyclist as I
24:11
mentioned. Uh, my garage looks like this
24:13
with a lot of bikes that aren't being
24:15
used. Um, I hope to use them again in
24:17
the future. Why isn't there an Airbnb
24:19
for bicycles? Why hasn't somebody built
24:21
that? Well, I'll tell you why. It's a
24:22
very bad idea. That's why nobody's done
24:23
it. And why is it a bad idea? Because
24:25
the central tenant, AI, not AI. It could
24:27
be in 2000 BC. It doesn't really matter.
24:29
If your customer acquisition cost plus
24:32
your cost of goods sold is greater than
24:35
your lifetime value, do not proceed.
24:38
That's not a business. But now with AI,
24:40
um, you know, imagine that I wanted to
24:42
start Airbnb for bicycles. Well, how am
24:44
I going to go get the people that have
24:45
spare bicycles in their garage? Am I
24:47
gonna hire a bunch of like, you know,
24:49
expensive Stanford kids in Palo Alto and
24:51
have to give them 20 different flavors
24:53
of coconut water and, you know, cater to
24:55
their millennial needs in order for them
24:56
to work in the sales operation in Palo
24:58
Alto? No, I'm going to have an AI sales
24:59
rep call everybody. And the cost per AI
25:02
sales rep per year is a few hundred
25:03
bucks, not $100,000. Uh, no coconut
25:06
water necessary. Well, what if there's
25:08
an emergency? Well, you know, now
25:09
there's a 1-800 number that you call
25:10
that's an AI rep that can do everything.
25:12
Call the police, call whatever. Um, and
25:14
you know, lastly, like how do I screen
25:16
this person, do a background check, is
25:17
the bicycle good, is it stole, like
25:19
whatever you would need to do this this
25:20
silly business that we're not going to
25:21
fund. Um, AI can do this as well. So,
25:24
you actually have a whole category of of
25:26
business which was like it would have
25:28
worked except for this pesky customer
25:30
acquisition cost or pesky pesky cost of
25:33
goods sold. And of course, AI, you can
25:35
vibe code your way into one of these
25:37
businesses anyway. Um so you know
25:39
massively expands the size of the market
25:41
the nonAI market given the AI
25:44
infrastructure just allowing you know
25:46
CAC to come down COGS to come down for
25:48
now I mean every company is going to
25:50
start using these tools so you know it
25:51
will it will become a version of the
25:53
yoga bear quote it's so crowded nobody
25:54
goes here anymore but now lot of
25:56
companies kind of prosecuting sometimes
25:59
older new ideas that just wouldn't have
26:01
worked 5 years ago
Conclusion: The Future of Software and Labor
26:03
um and this is a global opportunity
26:04
right I mean like the the US labor
26:06
market big it's 13 trillion a year. The
26:08
worldwide labor market's so much bigger.
26:10
And our job on on behalf of your capital
26:13
here, our our labor on behalf of your
26:14
capital is to find the best companies
26:16
that will make software look small. So,
26:18
thank you very much.
