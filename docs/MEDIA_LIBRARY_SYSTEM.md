# Media Library System - Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview

The Media Library app is a universal media management system for L4YERCAK3.com that provides centralized storage, organization, and reuse of images across the platform.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (`organizationMedia`)
- ✅ Multi-tenant organization isolation
- ✅ Convex Storage integration for file storage
- ✅ File metadata (filename, mimeType, sizeBytes, dimensions)
- ✅ Usage tracking (usageCount, lastUsedAt)
- ✅ Categorization (template, logo, avatar, general)
- ✅ Tags and descriptions for searchability
- ✅ Indexes for efficient queries

### 2. Backend API (`convex/organizationMedia.ts`)
- ✅ `getStorageUsage` - Calculate storage usage with quotas by plan
- ✅ `generateUploadUrl` - Create upload URLs with quota enforcement
- ✅ `saveMedia` - Save file metadata after upload
- ✅ `listMedia` - Browse organization's media library
- ✅ `deleteMedia` - Remove files and update quotas
- ✅ `updateMedia` - Modify metadata
- ✅ `incrementUsage` - Track media reuse across templates

### 3. Storage Quotas by Plan
- **Free**: 100 MB
- **Personal**: 500 MB
- **Pro**: 1 GB
- **Business**: 5 GB
- **Enterprise**: 20 GB

### 4. Media Library Window Component
Three-tab interface for complete media management:

#### **Library Tab**
- Grid view of all media files
- Image thumbnails with file info
- Click to select in selection mode
- Delete button with confirmation
- Visual selection indicator

#### **Upload Tab**
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Click to browse file picker
- Real-time upload progress bar
- Quota validation before upload
- Automatic metadata storage

#### **Settings Tab**
- Storage usage visualization
- Quota progress bar with color warnings:
  - Green: < 75% used
  - Yellow: 75-90% used
  - Red: > 90% used
- File count statistics
- Plan information display

### 5. ImageInput Integration
Updated the dynamic form generator's `ImageInput` component with three modes:

- **📁 Media Library** (default): Browse and select from existing media
- **Enter URL**: Manual URL input
- **Upload File**: Direct file upload

The Media Library mode opens a selection window that returns the chosen image URL directly to the form field.

### 6. App Registration
- ✅ Registered in `seedApps.ts` as `media-library`
- ✅ Available to all plan levels
- ✅ Category: `content`
- ✅ Icon: 📁

### 7. Window Integration
- ✅ Added to Start Menu under Programs
- ✅ Can be opened standalone from menu
- ✅ Opens in selection mode from ImageInput
- ✅ Supports callback-based selection

### 8. Context System
Created `MediaSelectionContext` for passing selection callbacks between windows when needed for advanced workflows.
