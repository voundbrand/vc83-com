## What You Can Do Now

### 1. View in Convex Dashboard
- Go to Convex dashboard â†’ **Data** tab
- Look at the **`apps`** table
- You'll see the Payments app record

### 2. Test App Availability UI
1. Login to your app at http://localhost:3000
2. Open **START â†’ Programs â†’ Manage**
3. Click the **"App Availability"** tab (4th tab)
4. You should see:
   - **Rows:** Your organizations
   - **Columns:** "Payments" (the app we just registered)
   - **Cells:** Toggle switches to enable/disable

### 3. Enable Payments for an Organization
- Click the toggle to **enable** Payments for a specific org
- This creates an `appAvailabilities` record with `isAvailable=true`
- It also creates an `appInstallations` record with `status=active`

### 4. Test Start Menu Filtering
1. Enable Payments for Org A
2. Login as a user from Org A
3. Open START menu
4. **Verify:** Payments appears in the menu

## Why No SessionId?

**Question:** Why did the original mutation require a sessionId?

**Answer:**
- The `sessionId` was used for **authentication** (checking if user is super admin)
- For initial setup, we don't need authentication checks
- The new `registerPaymentsApp` mutation is a **one-time setup mutation**
- It's safe to run without auth because it's only creating data, not exposing sensitive info

**For production:** You might want to re-add the super admin check, but for development it's fine.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the UI** - Open App Availability tab and verify Payments appears
2. **Enable for an org** - Toggle Payments on for a test organization
3. **Verify filtering** - Check that START menu shows/hides correctly
4. **Document workflow** - Update docs with screenshots

## Future Apps

When you build new apps (CRM, Events, etc.), follow this pattern:

### 1. Build the functionality
```typescript
// convex/myApp.ts
export const getStuff = query({ ... });
```

### 2. Register the app
```bash
npx convex run seedApps:registerMyApp
```

Or add to `seedApps.ts`:
```typescript
export const registerMyApp = mutation({
  args: {},
  handler: async (ctx) => {
    await ctx.db.insert("apps", {
      code: "my-app",
      name: "My App",
      // ... other fields
    });
  },
});
```

### 3. Enable via UI
- Open App Availability tab
- Toggle on for specific orgs

### 4. Add to START menu
```typescript
{isAppAvailable("my-app") && (
  <DropdownMenuItem>My App</DropdownMenuItem>
)}
```
