# Account Deletion System

## Overview

The account deletion system implements a **2-week grace period** before permanent deletion, giving users time to change their mind and restore their account.

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Grace Period (14 Days)

When a user deletes their account:

1. **`scheduledDeletionDate`** is set to 2 weeks from now
2. **User CAN still log in** normally
3. **All data preserved**:
   - Password remains active
   - Organization memberships intact
   - Owned organizations remain active
   - All permissions and roles preserved

### Phase 2: Permanent Deletion (Automatic)

After 14 days, a scheduled job runs daily at 2 AM UTC:

1. **Finds expired accounts**: `scheduledDeletionDate < now`
2. **Blocks login**: Sets `isActive: false`
3. **Archives owned organizations**: All orgs owned by user
4. **Removes memberships**: User removed from all organizations
5. **Logs audit event**: Full deletion trail

## User Experience

### During Grace Period

**Taskbar Warning:**
- Red warning badge appears next to clock: `⚠️ "14 DAYS"`
- Counts down daily: "13 DAYS", "12 DAYS", etc.
- Clickable - opens Settings to restore account
- Tooltip shows exact deletion date

**Settings Panel:**
- Shows orange "Account Restoration" section
- Warning banner with deletion date
- Green "Restore My Account" button
- One click to restore - instant reactivation

### After Grace Period

**Login Blocked:**
- Error: "Dieses Konto wurde dauerhaft gelöscht."
- No recovery possible
- All data permanently removed

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema

```typescript
// users table
{
  scheduledDeletionDate?: number; // Timestamp for deletion (14 days from request)
  isActive?: boolean;              // false after permanent deletion
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Backend Functions

**[convex/accountManagement.ts](../convex/accountManagement.ts)**

1. **`deleteAccount`** (action)
   - Sets `scheduledDeletionDate = now + 14 days`
   - Does NOT block login
   - Logs out user (deletes session)

2. **`restoreAccount`** (action)
   - Clears `scheduledDeletionDate`
   - Instant reactivation
   - Logs audit event

3. **`permanentlyDeleteExpiredAccounts`** (scheduled mutation)
   - Runs daily at 2 AM UTC
   - Finds users with `scheduledDeletionDate < now`
   - Archives organizations
   - Removes memberships
   - Sets `isActive: false`
   - Logs permanent deletion

### Scheduled Job

**[convex/crons.ts](../convex/crons.ts)**

```typescript
crons.daily(
  "Permanently delete expired accounts",
  {
    hourUTC: 2,    // 2 AM UTC
    minuteUTC: 0,
  },
  internal.accountManagement.permanentlyDeleteExpiredAccounts
);
```

**Runs:** Daily at 2:00 AM UTC
**Processes:** All accounts with expired grace periods
**Logs:** Full console output with [CRON] prefix

### Frontend Components

**Taskbar Warning:**
- **File**: [src/app/page.tsx](../src/app/page.tsx#L215-233)
- **Hook**: `useAccountDeletionStatus()`
- **Shows**: Days remaining, animated warning icon

**Restore Button:**
- **File**: [src/components/window-content/manage-window/user-edit-modal.tsx](../src/components/window-content/manage-window/user-edit-modal.tsx#L431-481)
- **Shows**: If `scheduledDeletionDate` exists
- **Action**: Calls `restoreAccount` action

## Testing

### Test Grace Period Flow

1. **Delete account:**
   ```
   Login → Settings → Edit Profile → Delete My Account
   → Type "DELETE MY ACCOUNT" → Confirm
   ```

2. **Verify warning appears:**
   - Check taskbar: ⚠️ "14 DAYS" badge visible
   - Click badge: Settings opens
   - Green "Restore My Account" button visible

3. **Restore account:**
   - Click "Restore My Account"
   - Success message appears
   - Page refreshes
   - Warning badge disappears

4. **Verify restoration:**
   - Can still access all organizations
   - All permissions intact
   - No data lost

### Test Scheduled Deletion (Dev Only)

**⚠️ Warning:** This will permanently delete test accounts!

```bash
# Manually trigger the cron job
npx convex run accountManagement:permanentlyDeleteExpiredAccounts

# Check console output
[CRON] Checking for expired accounts...
[CRON] Found 0 expired accounts to delete
[CRON] No expired accounts found.
```

To test with actual deletion:

1. Create test account
2. Manually set `scheduledDeletionDate` to past date:
   ```bash
   npx convex run --open
   # In dashboard, update user record
   ```
3. Run cron manually
4. Verify account is deleted

## Security Considerations

### What's Protected

✅ **During Grace Period:**
- User can still access everything normally
- Password works for login
- All permissions active
- Organizations accessible

✅ **After Permanent Deletion:**
- Login blocked completely
- Owned organizations archived
- All memberships removed
- Audit trail preserved

### Audit Logging

All deletion events are logged:

```typescript
// Grace period initiated
{
  action: "delete_account",
  metadata: { deletionScheduled: true, gracePeriodDays: 14 }
}

// Account restored
{
  action: "restore_account"
}

// Permanent deletion
{
  action: "permanent_delete_account",
  metadata: {
    email: "user@example.com",
    originalDeletionDate: 1234567890,
    deletedAt: 1234567890
  }
}
```

## Monitoring

### Cron Job Logs

Check Convex dashboard logs for daily cron execution:

```bash
# Filter logs for cron activity
[CRON] Checking for expired accounts...
[CRON] Found X expired accounts to delete
[CRON] Permanently deleting account: user@example.com
[CRON] ✅ Successfully deleted account: user@example.com
[CRON] Completed deletion of X expired accounts.
```

### Metrics to Track

- Number of deletion requests per day
- Restoration rate (how many users restore)
- Average time before restoration
- Failed deletions (check error logs)

## FAQ

**Q: Can users access their data during the grace period?**
A: Yes! Full access to everything. The grace period is completely transparent - users can use the app normally.

**Q: What happens to owned organizations?**
A: During grace period: Nothing changes. After grace period: Organizations are archived (set to inactive).

**Q: Can admin restore a permanently deleted account?**
A: No. Once the 14-day period ends and the cron job runs, deletion is permanent.

**Q: What if the cron job fails?**
A: The job runs daily, so it will retry the next day. Failed deletions are logged but don't block other deletions.

**Q: Can users extend the grace period?**
A: No. It's a fixed 14-day period. Users can restore anytime during those 14 days.

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Email notifications (7 days before deletion, 1 day before deletion)
- [ ] Configurable grace period length (per organization/plan)
- [ ] Export user data before deletion
- [ ] "Soft restore" for admin recovery (within 30 days of permanent deletion)
