# Non-Markdown Legacy Assets (2026-02-16)

Purpose:
- archive legacy asset-only folders that are not canonical documentation
- reduce top-level `docs/` clutter and drift risk

Moved folders:
- `docs/000_pdfs/`
- `docs/screenshots/`
- `docs/ctc-nordstern/`

Notes:
- these folders had no markdown files and no active markdown references
- restore only if a canonical doc explicitly needs one of these assets
