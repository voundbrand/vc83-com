# What is l4yercak3?

## Overview

l4yercak3 (pronounced "Layer Cake") is a **B2B workflow platform** that helps businesses of all shapes and sizes streamline their operations through AI-powered tools and integrated applications.

## The Layer Cake Concept

The name "Layer Cake" represents our core philosophy: **layer individual applications on top of each other** to build a complete business workflow system. Each layer adds new capabilities while seamlessly integrating with the others.

## Who It's For

- **Businesses of all sizes**: From small teams to large enterprises
- **Not just startups**: Built for established businesses with real operational needs
- **Teams needing digital tools**: Companies modernizing their customer and project management

- **Form Builder**: Custom forms for data collection

### Business Operations

### AI Integration

Every layer includes AI capabilities to:

## The "Retro Desktop" Interface

We wrap all these powerful tools in a nostalgic, retro desktop interface that:
- Makes complex workflows feel approachable
- Reduces cognitive load through familiar metaphors
- Provides a consistent, cozy workspace
- Keeps everything organized in "windows" and "apps"

## Value Proposition

Instead of paying for and managing multiple separate tools (CRM, email marketing, invoicing, project management, etc.), businesses get everything in one integrated platform where:

1. **Data flows between layers**: Your CRM knows about your invoices, your email campaigns, your projects
2. **AI works across all layers**: Learn from all your business data, not just one silo
3. **One workspace**: No switching between dozens of tabs and tools
4. **Consistent experience**: Same interface, same workflow principles

## Tagline

**"Layer on the superpowers."** 🚀
