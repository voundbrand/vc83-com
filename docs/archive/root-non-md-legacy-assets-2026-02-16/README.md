# Root Non-Markdown Legacy Assets (2026-02-16)

Purpose:
- archive miscellaneous non-markdown files that were cluttering `docs/` root
- keep active docs root focused on index/governance markdown

Moved examples:
- spreadsheets, screenshots, transcripts, HTML/JSONL exports
- `READY_TO_USE_CHECKOUT_INTEGRATION.tsx` reference file

Notes:
- restore only when a canonical doc explicitly requires one of these assets
