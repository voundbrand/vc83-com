# Root MD Archive - Referenced And Migrated (2026-02-16)

These files were moved from `docs/` root to canonical support folder:
- `docs/reference_docs/`

They were also snapshotted here for immutable historical traceability.

Migration intent:
- reduce root-level docs sprawl
- keep references stable via canonical support folder
- separate active architecture contracts from legacy implementation notes
