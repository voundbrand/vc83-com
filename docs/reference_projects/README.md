# Reference Projects (Local-Only)

Purpose:
- keep external/reference codebases and prototype app scaffolds in one place
- separate code-heavy reference material from canonical documentation zones
- reduce drift and noise in docs navigation

Current contents:
- `docs/reference_projects/bring_it_all_together_assets/`
- `docs/reference_projects/l4yercak3-cli/`
- `docs/reference_projects/l4yercak3_systems/`
- `docs/reference_projects/openclaw/`

Rules:
1. Do not treat this folder as product source-of-truth.
2. Do not reference this folder from canonical architecture docs.
3. CI docs guard blocks commit paths inside this folder.
4. If a concept is adopted, document it in canonical docs and archive the source note trail.
