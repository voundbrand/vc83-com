## The Internal Belief

| Their Belief | The Truth |
|-------------|-----------|
| "I'm a marketer, not a software engineer. I can't run a platform. I can't configure AI agents. This is for technical people." | You don't code anything. You configure templates. If you can fill out a form and upload a document, you can deploy an AI agent to a client in under an hour. |

---

## HOOK

> "'I'm not a tech person.' Every agency owner who's stuck says this. It's the belief that's costing you the most."

---

## SCRIPT

### 1. Name the False Belief (30 sec)

> "Here's what you probably tell yourself:
>
> 'I'm a marketing professional, not a software engineer.'
>
> Maybe it sounds like: 'I don't know how to set up AI.' Or: 'I'd need a developer for this.' Or: 'This platform stuff is for technical people.'
>
> I hear this every single week."

### 2. Why They Believe It (30-45 sec)

> "And I get it. You believe this because every tool you've used made you feel like you needed a CS degree.
>
> GoHighLevel has 47 menu items. n8n looks like a circuit board. Setting up a WhatsApp Business API sounds like it requires a developer on retainer.
>
> You tried to build something once, hit a wall at hour 6, and decided 'this isn't for me.'
>
> It makes sense you'd think that. The tools were built for developers and then marketed to you."

### 3. The Cost of This Belief (30-45 sec)

> "But here's what this belief is costing you:
>
> You're paying someone else EUR 2,000 to set up what takes 30 minutes on the right platform. You're turning down client opportunities because 'I don't know how to deliver that.' You're watching other agency owners -- no more technical than you -- charge EUR 300/month per client for AI agents they configured in an afternoon.
>
> This belief isn't protecting you. It's capping your revenue."

### 4. The Reframe (45-60 sec)

> "Here's the truth: you don't need to be technical. You need a platform that's built for non-technical people.
>
> Think about what you already do. You set up Facebook ad campaigns. You configure email sequences. You build landing pages in Canva or whatever tool you use.
>
> Configuring an AI agent on the right platform is the same thing. Pick a template -- salon, plumber, dentist, restaurant. Upload the client's FAQ. Set the tone. Connect WhatsApp, email, web chat. Done.
>
> You're not building software. You're filling in blanks.
>
> The agency owner who deployed an AI agent for a cleaning company in 30 minutes and charged EUR 500? Not a developer. A marketer with a template."

### 5. Your Story (30-45 sec)

> "I believed the same thing -- from the other side. I thought agencies would never adopt a platform like this because 'they're not technical enough.'
>
> Then I watched non-technical agency owners in our community configure their first client portal in under an hour. No support calls. No developer. Just templates and a few clicks.
>
> The technical barrier was never about you. It was about the tools."

### 6. The Offer -- Pro Tier (45-60 sec)

> "This is why I built l4yercak3 with a free tier that actually works.
>
> Sign up for free. Connect your tools. See agents do the work -- connect forms to CRM, set up checkout, build email sequences. All within your daily credits.
>
> When you're ready to go live with real clients, Pro is EUR 29 a month. That gives you:
>
> - 200 credits per month for AI agent actions
> - Full CRM with import/export
> - Email sequences and workflows
> - Stripe checkout and invoicing
> - Booking with calendar sync
> - Everything you need to serve clients professionally
>
> No per-client fees. You set your own pricing. A client paying you EUR 199/month costs you about EUR 3 in AI credits. The rest is yours."

### 7. CTA (15-30 sec)

> "If you're ready to stop telling yourself you're 'not technical enough' and start deploying clients this week -- sign up for free. The link is below.
>
> No credit card. No onboarding call. Just start.
>
> And if you want to understand the one external barrier that stops most agencies from scaling past EUR 10K/month -- watch Video 4."
