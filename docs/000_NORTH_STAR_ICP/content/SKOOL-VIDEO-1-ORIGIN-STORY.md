## ICP Context

**Your ICP:** Agency owners (marketing, digital, consulting) managing 10-50+ SMB clients, drowning in tool fragmentation, capped at 15-20 clients, paying EUR 600-1,000/mo for tools that don't talk to each other.

**Where they are now:** The bottleneck. Every new client = more manual work. Midnight WhatsApp messages. 6 tools duct-taped together. Building a job, not a business.

**Where they want to be:** Configure once, deploy to every client in minutes, charge recurring revenue, stop being the bottleneck.

## HOOK

> "If you're running a marketing agency and every new client means more work for you personally -- welcome home."

## SCRIPT

### 1. Your Story (60-90 sec)

> "I ran a marketing agency for five years. EUR 240,000 a year in recurring revenue. Four employees. Solid client base -- mele Group, HaffNet, Hinrichs.
>
> And I took home nothing.
>
> Every month: EUR 500 to EUR 1,000 in software. GoHighLevel, HubSpot, form builders, email tools -- the whole stack. Every new client: two to three weeks to onboard. My team spent more time fighting the tools than doing the work.
>
> I watched my team sit there waiting for pages to load. I watched automations send the wrong emails to the wrong people. I called support and got a ticket number and silence.
>
> I was the bottleneck. Not because I wasn't working hard enough. Because the tools were broken. EUR 240k in revenue. Nothing left at the end of the month."

### 2. The Gap You Discovered (30-45 sec)

> "Then I realized something: the problem wasn't me. It wasn't my team. It wasn't even the clients.
>
> It was the tools. Every 'all-in-one' platform was either overbuilt and slow, or missing the things we actually needed. Proper invoicing. WhatsApp integration. Client portals that didn't look like they were built in 2018. A page builder that loads in under 10 seconds.
>
> The real problem: there was no platform built for how agencies actually work."

### 3. The Pivot (30 sec)

> "So I shut the agency down. Went back to what I actually know -- software engineering. Twenty years of it. And I built the platform that would have saved my agency.
>
> One place to configure everything a client needs. White-label it under your brand. Deploy in minutes instead of weeks."

### 4. What This Community Is (15-30 sec)

> "This community is for agency owners who want to stop being the bottleneck and start running a platform. Not another guru promising EUR 50K months. Not another course about 'mindset.' A working system for delivering professional marketing to clients -- under your brand, with tools that actually work.
>
> If you're here, you're already ahead of 90% of agencies still duct-taping tools together."

### 5. CTA (15 sec)

> "Next video, I'm going to show you why the tools you're using right now are fundamentally broken -- and what changed in the last 18 months that makes the old approach obsolete. Watch Video 2."

## Shot Notes

- Direct to camera
- Conversational, not scripted-sounding
- Background: Your actual workspace (desk, monitors -- real, not staged)
- Energy: Warm, relatable, "I've been there"
- Slight frustration when talking about tools breaking -- authentic, not performative
