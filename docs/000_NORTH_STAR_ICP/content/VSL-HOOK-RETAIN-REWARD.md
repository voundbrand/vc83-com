## The Three False Beliefs (from ICP research)

| Belief | What They Think | The Truth |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Vehicle** | "All-in-one platforms are slow, overbuilt, and overpriced" | l4yercak3 is fast, simple, AI-native, and free to start |
| **Internal** | "I'm a marketer, not a software engineer -- I can't run a platform" | You don't build anything. You configure templates and deploy. |
| **External** | "The market is saturated, clients won't pay, I can't compete with bigger agencies" | Agencies are charging EUR 199-499/month per client right now. 60-80% of inbound calls go unanswered. The opportunity is massive. |

## HOOK (0:00-0:15)

> "You're running a marketing agency. You've got 15 clients. And every single new client means more work -- for you personally.
>
> More WhatsApp messages at midnight. More tools to wire together. More invoices eating your margin.
>
> You're building a job, not a business. And the platform you're paying EUR 300 a month for was built in 2018."

**Why this works:** Uses their exact language from Reddit ("I'm the bottleneck," "building a job, not a business"). Calls out the specific EUR 300/mo GHL pain. Hits the midnight WhatsApp messages -- validated across every DACH research thread.

## RETAIN (0:15-1:30)

### The Problem Stack (0:15-0:45)

> "Here's what your week actually looks like:
>
> Monday -- you spend 3 hours onboarding a new client. Setting up their CRM. Wiring forms to email. Configuring their booking page. Again.
>
> Wednesday -- a lead comes in at 9pm. Nobody answers. That's EUR 2,000 in missed revenue for a plumber who's paying you to handle this.
>
> Friday -- your client asks for a report. You open six tabs across three tools to pull together numbers that should be in one dashboard.
>
> You're paying EUR 600 to EUR 1,000 a month in software. CRM here. Page builder there. Forms somewhere else. Payments in another tab. And you're STILL the one duct-taping it together.
>
> Every new client doesn't mean more revenue. It means more hours."

**Why this works:** Walks through their actual week. Uses the "6 tools" language pattern. EUR 2,000 missed revenue is from SMB research. The "six tabs" image mirrors their reality.

### The Gap (0:45-1:00)

> "I ran an agency for five years. EUR 240,000 a year in revenue. Four employees. And I took home nothing.
>
> Because the tools were the bottleneck. Not me. Not my team. The tools.
>
> So I shut it down. And I built the platform I wished I had."

**Why this works:** Founder story in 15 seconds. Establishes credibility. "The tools were the bottleneck" reframes the problem from personal failure to systemic failure.

### The Vehicle (1:00-1:30)

> "One platform. Everything your client needs -- pages, CRM, email, payments, booking. Configure it once. White-label it under your brand. Deploy to every new client in minutes.
>
> Your client logs in and sees YOUR logo, YOUR colors, YOUR domain. Not ours.
>
> No rebuilding from scratch. No wiring tools together. No 3-week onboarding.
>
> Configure. Brand. Deploy. That's it."

**Why this works:** "Configure once, deploy to every client" is the dream statement from research. White-label is the #1 feature request. "Minutes not weeks" is the speed promise that directly contrasts GHL's 2-3 week setup cycle.

---

## REWARD (1:30-2:15)

### The Transformation (1:30-1:50)

> "This week, you could have three clients onboarded -- each with their own branded portal. Leads, payments, bookings, email -- all flowing through one platform.
>
> You configured once. Deployed three times. No rebuilding from scratch.
>
> Recurring revenue growing. And you're not answering WhatsApp messages at midnight anymore."

**Why this works:** Mirrors the "Imagine This Instead" section of the landing page. Concrete (three clients, this week), not abstract.

### The Proof Points (1:50-2:00)

> "Integrations with Stripe, Google, WhatsApp Business API, ActiveCampaign, and more. AI agents that handle the wiring -- forms to CRM, checkout to invoicing, WhatsApp to lead capture, booking to calendar -- so you don't have to.
>
> Free to start. Pay only for what you use."

**Why this works:** Leads with what's real today -- integrations (including WhatsApp Business API) and AI agent capabilities. "Free to start" removes the risk barrier.

### The CTA (2:00-2:15)

> "Sign up for free. Set up your first client portal today.
>
> No credit card. No onboarding calls. No 3-week learning curve.
>
> Configure, brand it yours, deploy.
>
> Link below."

**Why this works:** Three objection removals in sequence. Ends with the 3-step framework (configure, brand, deploy) that mirrors the landing page.

## Shot Notes

- **Setting:** At desk or standing, casual but professional. Not a studio -- real workspace.
- **Energy:** Conversational, slightly frustrated at the start (empathy), confident by the end (guide).
- **Pacing:** Hook is fast. Problem stack is deliberate (let each pain point land). Vehicle and reward are faster, forward-momentum energy.
- **Graphics:** None needed for V1. If adding: show the 6-tool stack visual during problem, then the single-platform visual during vehicle.
- **Length:** Target 2:00-2:30. Cut ruthlessly.

## Clip Variations

### 15-Second Hook (Social)
> "You're running an agency. 15 clients. And every new client means more work for you personally. You're building a job, not a business."

### 30-Second Problem (YouTube Pre-Roll)
> "EUR 600 a month in software. CRM here. Page builder there. Forms, payments, booking -- all in different tabs. And you're still the one wiring it together. Every new client means weeks of setup. There's a better way."

### 60-Second Full Loop (Instagram Reel / TikTok)
> Hook + Problem Stack (condensed) + "One platform. Configure once. White-label it. Deploy in minutes. Free to start." + CTA

## German Version Notes

Record a separate DE version, not a dub. Key language shifts:
- "Du bist der Flaschenhals" (You're the bottleneck)
- "Eine Plattform statt sechs Tools" (One platform instead of six tools)
- "Konfigurieren, deine Marke drauf, deployen"
- Use "du" not "Sie" -- agency owners are informal
