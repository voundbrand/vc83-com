## Pricing Strategy

### **Psychology**

**1. Anchoring**
- Show Enterprise tier first to anchor high
- Makes Agency tier look reasonable
- Growth tier looks like a bargain

**2. Decoy Effect**
- Starter tier is "too limited" for most
- Agency tier "slightly expensive" for most
- Growth tier is Goldilocks (by design)

**3. Value Metric**
- Price by conversations, not just sub-accounts
- Aligns with value delivered (more conversations = more value)
- Transparent and predictable

**4. Annual Discount**
- 20% off = 2.4 months free
- Reduces churn significantly
- Improves cash flow

### **Competitive Positioning**

**vs. GHL Native AI:**
- GHL: Free (but doesn't work well)
- Us: $49-299/mo (but 20% better conversion)
- ROI: 10-50x on average

**vs. Custom Development:**
- Custom: $10K-50K + $2K-5K/mo maintenance
- Us: $49-299/mo, no maintenance
- Break-even: 1-3 months vs. 2-3 years

**vs. General AI Tools:**
- OpenAI API: ~$100-500/mo in API costs alone
- Us: $49-299/mo fully managed
- Includes: Infrastructure, maintenance, updates, support

### **Price Increases**

**Grandfathering Policy:**
- Existing customers keep their price forever (if annual)
- Monthly customers: 30 days notice for increases
- Increases only on new signups or upgrades

**When to Increase:**
- Year 2: +10-20% across all tiers
- As we add more features/value
- When market demands it (if waitlist forms)

## Unit Economics

```

**Growth Tier ($99/mo):**
```
Revenue:              $99.00
- LLM API costs:      $40.00 (2,500 conv × $0.016 avg)
- Infrastructure:     $5.00
- Support:            $3.00  (email + chat)
- Payment processing: $3.00  (3%)
= Gross Margin:       $48.00 (48%)
```

**Agency Tier ($299/mo):**
```
Revenue:              $299.00
- LLM API costs:      $160.00 (10,000 conv × $0.016 avg)
- Infrastructure:     $10.00
- Support:            $15.00  (priority + calls)
- Payment processing: $9.00   (3%)
= Gross Margin:       $105.00 (35%)
```

**Blended (assuming 10% Starter, 60% Growth, 30% Agency):**
```
ARPU:                 $158
Blended margin:       45%
```

### **LTV / CAC Analysis**

**Assumptions:**
- Average monthly churn: 5%
- Average customer lifetime: 20 months
- CAC: $200 (blended across channels)

**LTV Calculation:**
```
ARPU: $158/mo
Lifetime: 20 months
Gross margin: 45%
LTV = $158 × 20 × 0.45 = $1,422

LTV/CAC = $1,422 / $200 = 7.1x ✅
```

**Payback Period:**
```
Payback = CAC / (ARPU × Gross Margin)
Payback = $200 / ($158 × 0.45)
Payback = 2.8 months ✅
```

**Target Metrics:**
- LTV/CAC: > 3x (we're at 7.1x ✅)
- Payback: < 12 months (we're at 2.8 ✅)
- Churn: < 5% monthly (target achieved)

### **Sensitivity Analysis**

**If churn increases to 7%:**
- Lifetime drops from 20 to 14 months
- LTV drops to $996
- LTV/CAC drops to 5x (still healthy)

**If CAC increases to $300:**
- LTV/CAC drops to 4.7x (acceptable)
- Payback increases to 4.2 months (acceptable)

**If we increase prices 20%:**
- ARPU increases to $190
- LTV increases to $1,706
- LTV/CAC jumps to 8.5x (excellent)
