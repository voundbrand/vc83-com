## Pricing Communication

### **Messaging by Tier**

**Starter ($49/mo):**
> "Perfect for solo agencies testing AI-powered reactivation. Get elephant memory for your first sub-account."

**Growth ($99/mo):**
> "Most popular for growing agencies. Handle multiple clients with unlimited memory and full analytics."

**Agency ($299/mo):**
> "For established agencies doing serious DBR volume. Includes white-label branding and priority support."

### **Objection Handling**

**"Too expensive compared to GHL's free AI"**
> "GHL's AI is free because it doesn't work well for DBR. Agencies using our memory engine see 20% higher conversion — that's an extra $5K-10K/month on average. We pay for ourselves in the first week."

**"Can I just build this myself?"**
> "Absolutely! Plan for 2-3 months of dev time + ongoing maintenance. Or start using ours today for less than your developer's hourly rate."

**"What if GHL copies this feature?"**
> "They might eventually, but we'll always be ahead. We're 100% focused on conversation intelligence, while they're building a full CRM platform. Plus, our architecture is significantly more sophisticated than a bolt-on feature would be."

**"How do I know it will work for my niche?"**
> "We have beta customers in real estate, coaching, fitness, SaaS, and more. Memory works across all industries because conversations follow similar patterns. Try it free for 14 days — if it doesn't improve your reactivation rate, we'll refund you."
