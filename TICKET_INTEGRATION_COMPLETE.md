# ✅ Ticket System Integration - COMPLETE

## 🎯 Summary

The ticket system is now **fully integrated** into the existing checkout flow while **keeping it generic and reusable** for all product types.

---

## 🔧 How It Works

### For ALL Products:
1. Customer completes checkout
2. Payment processed via Stripe
3. **Receipt email sent** with purchase details
4. Success page shows confirmation

### For Ticket Products ONLY (subtype: "ticket"):
1. Customer completes checkout
2. Payment processed via Stripe
3. **Ticket email sent** with QR code + event details
4. **Receipt email sent** with purchase breakdown
5. Success page mentions "tickets sent to your email"

---

## 📧 What Gets Sent

### All Products Get:
- ✅ Professional receipt email
- ✅ Transaction confirmation
- ✅ Purchase summary

### Ticket Products Also Get:
- ✅ Beautiful ticket email with QR code
- ✅ Event details (date, location, etc.)
- ✅ Scannable QR code for entry
- ✅ Ticket number and holder information

---

## 🎨 Integration Points

### Backend (Automatic)

**[convex/checkoutSessions.ts](convex/checkoutSessions.ts:747-785)**
```typescript
// After successful payment:
1. Creates purchase_item records
2. Creates tickets (if product.subtype === "ticket")
3. Sends receipt email (always)
4. Sends ticket emails (only for tickets)
5. Marks session complete
```

### Frontend (Generic)

**[src/components/checkout/steps/confirmation-step.tsx](src/components/checkout/steps/confirmation-step.tsx:43-46)**
```typescript
// Checks product type and shows appropriate message:
const hasTicketProducts = linkedProducts.some(
  (p) => (p as any).subtype === "ticket"
);

// Success message adapts:
hasTicketProducts
  ? "Your tickets have been sent to your email with QR codes."
  : "Your order has been confirmed."
```

---

## 🔀 Product Type Detection

The system automatically detects product type using the `subtype` field:

```typescript
// Ticket product
{
  type: "product",
  subtype: "ticket",  // ← This triggers ticket generation
  name: "VIP Concert Ticket",
  ...
}

// Other product
{
  type: "product",
  subtype: "digital",  // ← No tickets, only receipt
  name: "E-Book Download",
  ...
}
```
