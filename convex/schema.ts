/**
 * ORGANIZED SCHEMA STRUCTURE

 * This schema is composed from modular definitions in the schemas/ directory.
 * See schemas/README.md for documentation on adding new apps.
 * 
 * Structure:
 * 1. Auth tables (from @convex-dev/auth)
 * 2. Core platform (users, organizations, memberships)
 * 3. App Store (apps registry, installations, purchases)
 * 4. Individual Apps (vc83pod, etc. - each is self-contained)
 * 5. Utilities (audit logs, invitations, email verification)
