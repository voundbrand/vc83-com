# Hero Definition Framework

Use this framework when helping an agency owner define WHO their client's customer is. This is `Business L4` hero identification — the most important step before building any agent, funnel, or content.

## Why Hero Definition Comes First

If you don't know the hero, you can't:
- Write copy that resonates
- Build an agent that speaks their language
- Create offers that solve real problems
- Design funnels that convert

The hero is NOT the agency owner's client. The hero is the **client's customer**.

## The Hero Profile

Walk the agency owner through these questions about their client's customer:

### 1. Demographics (Who are they?)
- What is their role? (homeowner, parent, business owner, patient, etc.)
- Where are they located? (city, region, neighborhood)
- What is their approximate age range?
- What is their income level? (relevant for pricing)
- What language do they speak? (critical for DACH region)

### 2. Psychographics (What do they think and feel?)
- What keeps them up at night related to this problem?
- What have they already tried that didn't work?
- What do they believe about themselves that holds them back? (internal belief)
- What do they believe about the market/world that holds them back? (external belief)
- What would they type into Google at 11pm when frustrated?

### 3. The Three Levels of Problem (StoryBrand)
- **External problem:** The tangible, visible thing they need solved (e.g., "my pipes are leaking")
- **Internal problem:** How the external problem makes them feel (e.g., "I feel helpless and anxious in my own home")
- **Philosophical problem:** Why it's just plain wrong (e.g., "a family shouldn't have to worry about their home falling apart")

### 4. The Villain
Every hero story has a villain. The villain is NOT a person — it's the root cause of their frustration:
- Complexity ("it shouldn't be this complicated to find a good plumber")
- Uncertainty ("how do I know who to trust?")
- Time waste ("I don't have time to call 10 different companies")
- Being ignored ("nobody calls me back")

### 5. The Desired Transformation
- **From:** [current state — frustrated, stuck, overwhelmed]
- **To:** [desired state — confident, relieved, taken care of]

## Output Format

When you complete hero definition with the agency owner, structure it as a knowledge base document:

```markdown
# Hero Profile: [Client Business Name]

## Who is the hero?
[One sentence describing the client's customer]

## Demographics
- Role: [...]
- Location: [...]
- Language: [...]

## What keeps them up at night?
[2-3 key frustrations in their own words]

## The Problem
- External: [tangible problem]
- Internal: [how it makes them feel]
- Philosophical: [why it's wrong]

## The Villain
[The root cause — not a person]

## The Transformation
- From: [current state]
- To: [desired state]

## How they search for help
[Keywords, phrases, questions they'd actually type/say]
```

Save this as a knowledge base document in the organization's media library. The customer-facing agent will use this to understand who it's talking to.

## Common Mistakes to Prevent

- **Don't let the agency owner describe themselves as the hero.** They are the guide. Their CLIENT is the guide. The client's CUSTOMER is the hero.
- **Don't accept vague answers.** "Everyone" is not a hero. Push for specifics.
- **Don't skip the internal problem.** This is where emotional connection lives. Agents that only address external problems sound robotic.
- **Don't forget language.** In the DACH region, the hero likely speaks German. The agent must match.
