# Plan and Call to Action Framework

Use this when helping an agency owner create the "plan" and "call to action" for their client's business. These are StoryBrand elements 4 and 5 — the bridge between the guide and the hero's transformation.

## Why the Plan Matters

Heroes don't take action without a clear plan. Confusion kills conversion. The plan removes risk and makes the next step obvious.

There are two types of plans:

### 1. The Process Plan (How It Works)
Reduces confusion. Shows the hero exactly what happens when they engage.

**Rules:**
- Maximum 3-4 steps (more = overwhelming)
- Each step starts with a verb
- Name the steps (makes them feel proprietary)
- The plan should feel easy

**Template:**
1. [First thing the customer does] — e.g., "Schedule a free consultation"
2. [What happens next] — e.g., "We assess your situation and create a plan"
3. [The result] — e.g., "We handle everything and you enjoy the result"

**Examples by vertical:**
- Plumber: "1. Call us. 2. We diagnose the problem same-day. 3. We fix it with a guaranteed price."
- Dentist: "1. Book online. 2. Come in for a pain-free exam. 3. Leave with a clear treatment plan."
- Restaurant marketing: "1. Tell us your goals. 2. We launch targeted ads. 3. Watch your tables fill up."

### 2. The Agreement Plan (What We Promise)
Reduces fear. Shows the hero what the guide commits to.

**Template:** A list of commitments that address the hero's fears.

**Examples:**
- "No hidden fees — the price we quote is the price you pay"
- "We show up on time, every time"
- "If you're not satisfied, we'll make it right"
- "Your data stays private — we never share your information"

## Building the Plan

Walk the agency owner through:

1. **What are the 3-4 steps a customer takes from first contact to result?**
   - Strip out internal complexity. The customer doesn't need to know about your processes.
   - Each step should make the customer feel closer to their goal.

2. **What is the customer afraid of?**
   - Wasting money
   - Being scammed
   - Making the wrong choice
   - Feeling stupid
   - Losing time

3. **What can the client promise to address those fears?**
   - Each fear gets a counter-promise in the agreement plan.

## The Call to Action

Every interaction must have a clear CTA. There are two types:

### Direct CTA (The Primary Ask)
The one thing you want the hero to do RIGHT NOW.

**Rules:**
- One CTA per interaction (not three)
- Use a verb: "Schedule," "Call," "Book," "Order," "Get"
- Make it specific: "Book your free 15-minute consultation" not "Learn more"
- Repeat it — the CTA should appear multiple times

**Common direct CTAs by vertical:**
- Service business: "Book a free estimate"
- Health/wellness: "Schedule your first visit"
- SaaS/digital: "Start your free trial"
- High-ticket: "Apply for a consultation"

### Transitional CTA (The Soft Ask)
For heroes who aren't ready yet. Captures them for follow-up.

**Rules:**
- Lower commitment than the direct CTA
- Provides immediate value
- Captures contact information
- Feeds into a nurture sequence

**Common transitional CTAs:**
- "Download our free guide to [topic]"
- "Get our [industry] checklist"
- "Watch our 2-minute explainer"
- "Take our quick quiz to find out [result]"

## Output Format

Structure as a knowledge base document:

```markdown
# Plan & CTA: [Client Business Name]

## Process Plan
1. [Step 1 — verb + action]
2. [Step 2 — verb + action]
3. [Step 3 — verb + result]

## Agreement Plan (Our Promises)
- [Promise 1 — addresses fear]
- [Promise 2 — addresses fear]
- [Promise 3 — addresses fear]

## Direct CTA
[The primary action — specific, verb-led]

## Transitional CTA
[The soft ask — value exchange for contact info]
```

## How the Agent Uses This

The customer-facing agent:
- Explains the process plan when the customer asks "how does this work?"
- References agreement promises when the customer hesitates
- Always drives toward the direct CTA
- Falls back to the transitional CTA if the customer isn't ready
- Never ends a conversation without presenting a CTA
