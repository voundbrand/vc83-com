# Guide Positioning Framework

Use this when helping an agency owner position their CLIENT as the trusted guide. In the canonical model, the client operates at `Business L3`, and the hero is their end-customer at `Business L4`.

## The Two Things a Guide Must Express

According to StoryBrand, a guide demonstrates exactly two qualities:

### 1. Empathy
The guide understands the hero's pain. Not in a clinical way — in a "I've been where you are" way.

**How to express empathy in the agent's voice:**
- Acknowledge the problem before offering solutions
- Use the hero's language (from the Hero Profile)
- Never dismiss or minimize the problem
- Show that the client understands the frustration

**Examples:**
- "We know how stressful [problem] can be..."
- "You shouldn't have to deal with [frustration]..."
- "We hear this from [hero type] all the time..."

### 2. Authority
The guide has the competence to solve the problem. Not arrogant — confident.

**How to express authority in the agent's voice:**
- Reference experience ("We've helped over X [hero type]...")
- Mention credentials only if relevant
- Show process ("Here's how we handle this...")
- Use social proof ("Our clients consistently report...")
- Be specific, not vague

**Examples:**
- "In our 12 years of [service], we've seen this pattern before..."
- "Our process for handling [problem] has three steps..."
- "We're certified by [authority] to handle [specific thing]..."

## Building the Guide Profile

Walk the agency owner through these questions about their client:

### Identity
- What is the client's business name?
- What do they do in one sentence?
- How long have they been doing it?
- What is their service area?

### Empathy Statements
- What does the client understand about their customer's frustration?
- How can they show they "get it"?
- What shared experience do they have with their customers?

### Authority Markers
- How many customers have they served?
- What certifications, awards, or recognitions do they have?
- What is their track record / success rate?
- What makes their process different?
- Do they have testimonials or case studies?

### Brand Voice
- How should the agent sound? (Professional, friendly, casual, expert, warm?)
- What tone fits their industry? (A plumber's voice is different from a therapist's voice)
- Are there words or phrases the client always uses?
- Are there words to avoid?
- What language? (German, English, dialect?)

### The One-Liner
Every guide needs a one-liner that captures: problem + solution + result.

**Template:** "We help [hero] overcome [problem] so they can [desired result]."

**Examples:**
- "We help homeowners fix plumbing emergencies fast so they can get back to their lives."
- "We help busy parents find trusted childcare so they can work without worry."
- "We help local restaurants fill empty tables with targeted online marketing."

## How the Agent Uses This

When the customer-facing agent is deployed for `Business L4` conversations:
- It speaks IN the brand voice defined here
- It leads with empathy, then backs with authority
- It uses the one-liner when introducing the business
- It references authority markers naturally in conversation
- It never breaks character — it IS the client's brand
