# Marketing Made Simple Framework (Agent-Adapted)

> You are helping an agency owner build a complete sales funnel for their CLIENT's business using the Marketing Made Simple framework. This creates the 5 essential marketing pieces every business needs. Apply at `Business L4`: the client (`Business L3`) is the guide, their end-customer is the hero.

## When to Use This Framework

Use this when:
- Setting up the client's lead generation system
- Creating email sequences for the client
- Building or improving the client's website messaging
- The agency owner asks "how do we get more leads for this client?"

## The 3 Phases of Customer Relationship

Every customer goes through these phases:

### Phase 1: Curiosity
The hero becomes aware of the client. First impression.
- **Goal:** Stop the scroll. Get attention.
- **Assets:** One-liner, ads, social posts, agent greeting
- **Key question the hero asks:** "What is this?"

### Phase 2: Enlightenment
The hero learns more and builds trust.
- **Goal:** Demonstrate expertise. Provide value.
- **Assets:** Lead generator, nurture emails, content
- **Key question the hero asks:** "Can this help me?"

### Phase 3: Commitment
The hero decides to buy.
- **Goal:** Make the CTA clear. Remove risk.
- **Assets:** Sales emails, landing page, direct CTA
- **Key question the hero asks:** "Should I do this now?"

## The 5 Marketing Pieces

### Piece 1: The One-Liner

A single sentence that clearly communicates what the client does.

**Formula:** Problem + Solution + Result

**Template:** "Most [hero type] struggle with [problem]. [Client] provides [solution] so you can [result]."

**Examples:**
- "Most homeowners dread plumbing emergencies. Schmidt & Sons provides same-day reliable repairs so you can get back to your life."
- "Most local restaurants struggle to fill tables on weekdays. Digital Boost runs targeted local ads so you see more customers walk through the door."

**Where to use it:**
- Agent greeting message
- Website header
- Social media bios
- Email signatures
- Elevator pitch

Ask the agency owner: What's the problem? What's the solution? What's the result? Combine into one sentence.

### Piece 2: The Website (Wireframe)

The client's website (or landing page) must follow this structure:

**Header (Above the fold):**
- Headline: The one-liner or promise
- Subheadline: How they do it (empathy + process preview)
- Direct CTA button
- Optional: hero image showing the RESULT (not the service)

**Stakes Section:**
- "The problem with [status quo] is..."
- 2-3 pain points in the hero's language
- End with: "It doesn't have to be this way"

**Value Proposition Section:**
- 3 benefits (not features) with icons/images
- Each benefit addresses a pain point
- Focus on outcomes, not processes

**Guide Section:**
- Brief intro to the client (empathy + authority)
- "We understand [pain]. With [authority marker], we help [hero type] achieve [result]."
- Optional: photo of the team/person

**Plan Section:**
- The 3-step process plan
- Makes it look easy
- Each step: verb + action + what they get

**Explanatory Section (optional):**
- More detail on products/services
- Pricing if applicable
- FAQ

**CTA Section:**
- Repeat the direct CTA
- Add urgency or incentive if genuine
- Transitional CTA as alternative

**Footer:**
- Contact info, hours, location
- Social links
- Privacy policy

### Piece 3: The Lead Generator

A free resource offered in exchange for contact information. This is the transitional CTA.

**Types that work well for local/service businesses:**
- Checklist: "The 5 Signs Your [Thing] Needs Attention"
- Guide: "The Homeowner's Guide to [Topic]"
- Quiz: "What Type of [Service] Do You Need?"
- Calculator: "How Much Does [Service] Really Cost?"
- Video: "3 Things to Know Before Hiring a [Service Provider]"

**Rules:**
- Solves a small problem immediately
- Positions the client as the expert
- Naturally leads toward the paid service
- Captures at minimum: name and email (or phone for WhatsApp)

Help the agency owner choose a lead generator type that fits their client's industry and creates the content.

### Piece 4: The Nurture Email Sequence

After someone downloads the lead generator, send a nurture sequence that builds trust over time.

**Use the Soap Opera Sequence (5 messages):**

1. **Welcome + Deliver** (immediately): Deliver the lead generator. Set expectations. Tease what's coming.

2. **The Backstory** (day 2): Why the client started this business. The origin story. Build empathy.

3. **The Insight** (day 3): The key thing the client learned that changed their approach. Break a false belief.

4. **Social Proof** (day 4): Customer story. Before → After → Result. Make the hero see themselves in the story.

5. **The Ask** (day 5): Direct CTA. Clear next step. Urgency if genuine. Risk reversal.

**Then switch to ongoing nurture (Seinfeld emails):**
- 1-2x per week
- Rotate: tips, stories, myth-busters, seasonal advice, testimonials
- Every message ends with a soft CTA
- Always in the client's brand voice

### Piece 5: The Sales Campaign

When it's time to sell (promotion, new service, seasonal push):

**6-email sales sequence:**

1. **Deliver value** — Teach something useful related to the offer
2. **Describe the problem** — Paint the pain picture
3. **Reveal the solution** — Introduce the offer
4. **Handle objections** — Address the top 3 reasons they hesitate
5. **Paradigm shift** — Share a testimonial or case study that reframes their thinking
6. **Last chance** — Direct CTA with urgency (if genuine)

## Integration with Agent

The agent uses these 5 pieces:
- **One-liner** → Agent greeting and introduction
- **Website structure** → Guides the client's web presence
- **Lead generator** → Agent offers this to visitors who aren't ready to buy
- **Nurture sequence** → Automated follow-up after lead capture
- **Sales campaign** → Triggered promotions or seasonal pushes

## Output Documents

Generate these for the client's KB:

1. **One-liner document** — Include in the guide profile
2. **Website wireframe** — Outline with actual copy for each section
3. **Lead generator content** — The actual checklist/guide/quiz
4. **Nurture email sequence** — 5 emails ready to send
5. **Sales campaign template** — 6 emails adaptable for different offers

## Common Mistakes to Prevent

- Writing about the client instead of the hero (hero is the customer, not the business)
- Feature-dumping instead of benefit-selling
- No clear CTA on the website
- Lead generator that doesn't relate to the paid service
- Nurture emails that sound like corporate newsletters instead of helpful advice from a guide
- Sales emails that feel pushy instead of guiding
