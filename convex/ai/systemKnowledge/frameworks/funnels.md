# Funnel Framework Library (Agent-Adapted)

> You are helping an agency owner design funnels for their CLIENT's business. A funnel is a guided path that takes a visitor from stranger to customer through a specific sequence, each step with one clear objective. Apply at `Business L4`: the client's end-customer is the hero being guided by the client's `Business L3` brand.

## When to Use This Framework

Use this when:
- The agency owner wants to generate leads for their client
- Designing an offer structure for a client's business
- Setting up automated sales sequences
- The agency owner asks "how do we turn website visitors into paying customers?"

## Core Principle

**Hook → Story → Offer** — on every page, in every ad, in every message.

- **Hook:** Grab attention (use the hero's pain language)
- **Story:** Build connection (guide demonstrates empathy + authority)
- **Offer:** Present the solution (with clear CTA)

## Before Building Any Funnel: The Value Ladder

Every client needs a value ladder — a progression of offers from free to premium:

```
FREE → LOW-TICKET → MID-TICKET → HIGH-TICKET → CONTINUITY
Lead magnet   $7-97      $200-2000    $5000+      $X/month
```

Ask the agency owner:
1. What does the client offer for FREE that provides value? (consultation, guide, assessment)
2. What's the first paid offering? (single service, small package)
3. What's the main offering? (core service, full package)
4. Is there a premium/VIP offering? (done-for-you, priority service)
5. Is there anything recurring? (maintenance plan, membership, retainer)

## Funnel Selection Guide

Based on the client's situation, recommend the right funnel:

### "The client needs more leads"
**→ Lead Squeeze Funnel**
- Simple: landing page → opt-in → thank you page
- Offer: lead generator (checklist, guide, quiz)
- Goal: capture contact info for follow-up
- Best for: any business starting from zero leads

### "The client has a low-ticket offer ($7-97)"
**→ Tripwire / Self-Liquidating Offer (SLO) Funnel**
- Landing page → checkout → upsell → thank you
- Goal: acquire buyers (not just leads) while covering ad costs
- Best for: businesses with a clear entry-point product

### "The client has a mid-ticket offer ($200-2000)"
**→ Webinar/Presentation Funnel**
- Registration → presentation (live or recorded) → offer page → checkout
- Goal: educate and sell in one sequence
- Best for: services that need explanation, coaching, courses

### "The client has a high-ticket offer ($5000+)"
**→ Application Funnel**
- Landing page → application form → qualification → call booking
- Goal: filter and qualify leads before sales conversation
- Best for: consulting, coaching, done-for-you services

### "The client wants recurring revenue"
**→ Continuity Funnel**
- Free trial or low-cost entry → membership/subscription
- Goal: reduce friction to start, retain with value
- Best for: maintenance plans, memberships, retainers

### "The client is launching something new"
**→ Product Launch / Challenge Funnel**
- Sequence of content building anticipation → launch event → offer
- Goal: create urgency and excitement
- Best for: new service launches, seasonal promotions

## Funnel Architecture

Every funnel follows this basic structure:

### 1. Traffic Source
Where the hero comes from:
- Google Ads (searching for solution)
- Social media ads (interrupted while browsing)
- Organic content (found through SEO/social)
- Referrals (word of mouth)
- Agent conversations (already engaged)

### 2. Landing Page
One page, one goal:
- Headline: Hook (problem → promise)
- Body: Story (empathy → authority → plan)
- CTA: Offer (one clear action)
- No navigation. No distractions. One path forward.

### 3. Conversion Event
The action the hero takes:
- Submits email/phone
- Books appointment
- Makes purchase
- Fills out application

### 4. Follow-Up Sequence
What happens after conversion:
- Immediate: confirmation + next steps
- Day 1-5: Soap Opera nurture sequence
- Ongoing: Seinfeld value emails
- Re-engagement: for those who didn't convert

### 5. Upsell/Next Step
Move them up the value ladder:
- Post-purchase: "Want us to also handle [related service]?"
- Post-consultation: "Here's our full package"
- Ongoing: "Upgrade to our maintenance plan"

## Building the Funnel with the Agent

When creating funnels, the agent generates:

1. **Funnel map** — visual flow of pages and sequences
2. **Copy for each page** — using the BrandScript from StoryBrand
3. **Email sequences** — using the follow-up sequences framework
4. **CTA definitions** — what action happens at each step
5. **Tracking plan** — what metrics to monitor

## Output Documents

Generate for the client's KB:

```markdown
# Funnel Strategy: [Client Business Name]

## Value Ladder
- Free: [lead generator / consultation]
- Entry: [first paid offering - price]
- Core: [main offering - price]
- Premium: [high-ticket - price]
- Continuity: [recurring - price/mo]

## Active Funnels

### Funnel 1: [Name] — [Type]
- **Traffic source:** [where leads come from]
- **Landing page:** [URL or description]
- **Conversion event:** [what the hero does]
- **Follow-up:** [sequence description]
- **Upsell path:** [next step]
- **Metrics to track:** [key metrics]
```

## The Golden Rule

> "Drive at least $1 million through a single funnel before creating any new funnels."

For most SMB clients, this means: pick ONE funnel, optimize it, and make it work. Don't build five funnels at once. Help the agency owner resist the urge to overcomplicate.

## Common Mistakes to Prevent

- Building a funnel before defining the hero (do ICP research first)
- Too many steps in the funnel (simpler = higher conversion)
- Multiple CTAs on a single page (one page, one goal)
- No follow-up sequence (most sales happen in follow-up, not on first visit)
- Fancy design over clear messaging (clarity beats creativity)
- Not matching the funnel to the offer price point (don't use a squeeze page for a $5000 service)
