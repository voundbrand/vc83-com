# ICP Research Framework (Agent-Adapted)

> You are helping an agency owner research and define the Ideal Customer Profile for their CLIENT's business. The ICP is the `Business L4` hero — the client's end-customer. This research drives everything: messaging, agent personality, follow-up sequences, and funnel design.

## When to Use This Framework

Use this when:
- Setting up a new client for the first time
- The agency owner says "I don't know who my client's customers really are"
- Building the hero profile for the knowledge base
- Before creating any messaging, funnels, or agent configuration

## The Research Process

### Phase 1: Initial Definition

Ask the agency owner about their client's customers:

1. **Who is the customer?**
   - Role/type (homeowner, parent, business owner, patient?)
   - Location and language (critical for DACH region)
   - Demographics (age range, income level?)

2. **What problem does the client solve for them?**
   - What's painful about their current situation?
   - What triggers them to seek help?

3. **What does success look like?**
   - What outcome do they want?
   - How would they measure it?

4. **Where do these customers look for help?**
   - Google? Social media? Word of mouth? Local directories?
   - What would they type into a search engine?

5. **What language do they use?**
   - How would they describe their problem in their own words?
   - Any industry jargon or local dialect?

6. **What have they tried before?**
   - Competitors or alternatives?
   - Why didn't those work?

### Phase 2: Research (Agent-Driven)

Based on the initial definition, the agent searches for real customer language and pain points:

**Sources to search:**
- Google reviews of similar businesses in the area
- Reddit/forum discussions about the problem
- Social media comments on competitor pages
- "People also ask" results on Google
- Review sites (Trustpilot, ProvenExpert, Google Maps)

**What to extract:**
- Direct quotes (preserve exact language)
- Emotional indicators (frustration, fear, hope, relief)
- Common complaints about competitors
- What customers praise when they find a good provider
- Questions they ask before buying

### Phase 3: Pain Point Analysis

Categorize findings into:

**Severity levels:**
- Critical: Blocks them entirely, causes significant distress
- High: Major friction, affects their life/business significantly
- Medium: Noticeable problem, they've found workarounds
- Low: Minor annoyance

**Problem types (map to StoryBrand):**
- External problems (tangible issues)
- Internal problems (emotional impact)
- Philosophical problems (why it's wrong)

### Phase 4: Language Patterns

Extract authentic phrases for the agent to use:

**Problem language:** How they describe the pain
- "I'm so frustrated with..."
- "Why is it so hard to find..."
- "I just want someone who..."

**Solution-seeking language:** How they look for help
- "Looking for recommendations..."
- "Has anyone used..."
- "Best [service] in [area]?"

**Aspirational language:** What they want to feel
- "Finally found someone who..."
- "Such a relief to..."
- "I wish I had found them sooner"

### Phase 5: Synthesis

Combine everything into actionable documents for the knowledge base.

## Output Documents

Generate these for the client's KB folder:

### Document 1: Hero Profile (01-hero-profile.md)

```markdown
# Hero Profile: [Client Business Name]

## Who is the hero?
[One sentence]

## Demographics
- Type: [role/situation]
- Location: [area]
- Language: [language]
- Age range: [if relevant]

## What keeps them up at night?
[2-3 frustrations in their own words]

## The Problem
- External: [tangible problem]
- Internal: [how it makes them feel]
- Philosophical: [why it's wrong]

## The Villain
[Root cause of their frustration]

## The Transformation
- From: [current state]
- To: [desired state]

## How they search for help
[Keywords, phrases, platforms they use]

## Competitors and Alternatives
| Alternative | Why they try it | Why it fails |
|---|---|---|
| [Alt 1] | [reason] | [shortcoming] |

## Language Patterns
### Pain language:
- "[phrase]"
- "[phrase]"

### Solution-seeking language:
- "[phrase]"
- "[phrase]"

### Aspirational language:
- "[phrase]"
- "[phrase]"
```

## Important Notes for the Agent

- **Always research in the client's market language.** If the client serves German-speaking customers, research in German.
- **Don't accept "everyone" as an ICP.** Push for specifics. The narrower the definition, the better the agent performs.
- **Use real language, not marketing speak.** The hero profile should read like the customer talks, not like a brochure.
- **This is iterative.** The first version will be a hypothesis. As the client's agent has real conversations, the KB should be updated with new language patterns and pain points.
- **Save all outputs as knowledge base documents** in the client's media library folder.
