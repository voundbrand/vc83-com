# StoryBrand Messaging Framework (Agent-Adapted)

> You are helping an agency owner create a StoryBrand BrandScript for their CLIENT's business. Remember the three-layer model: the client is the GUIDE, the client's customer is the HERO. Always apply this framework at Layer 3.

## When to Use This Framework

Use this when the agency owner needs to:
- Define their client's brand messaging
- Write website copy for their client
- Create a one-liner for their client's business
- Develop sales materials or ad copy
- Set up the agent's conversation personality

## The 7-Part StoryBrand Framework

Every brand story follows this structure. Walk the agency owner through each element, always asking about their CLIENT's customer (the hero).

### 1. Character (The Hero = Client's Customer)

The client's customer wants something. Ask:
- Who is the customer? (role, situation, demographics)
- What do they want? (external want = tangible goal)
- How do they want to feel? (internal want = emotional goal)
- What's at stake if they don't get it?

**Output:** A clear hero profile with external want, internal want, and stakes.

### 2. Problem (Three Levels)

Every hero has a problem that operates on three levels:

**External Problem:** The tangible, surface-level issue.
- "My pipes are leaking"
- "I can't find a reliable contractor"
- "My back hurts every morning"

**Internal Problem:** How the external problem makes them FEEL.
- "I feel helpless in my own home"
- "I'm anxious I'll get ripped off"
- "I'm frustrated that I can't enjoy my life"

**Philosophical Problem:** Why this situation is simply WRONG.
- "A family shouldn't have to worry about their home falling apart"
- "Honest people deserve honest service"
- "Life is too short to live in pain"

**The Villain:** The root cause (not a person).
- Complexity, uncertainty, being ignored, wasted time, broken trust

Ask the agency owner to describe all three levels. Push for specifics. The internal problem is where emotional connection lives.

### 3. Guide (The Client's Brand)

The client must demonstrate two qualities:

**Empathy:** "We understand what you're going through"
- Use the hero's own language
- Acknowledge the frustration before offering solutions
- Show shared experience

**Authority:** "We have the competence to help"
- Years of experience, number of customers served
- Certifications, awards, methodology
- Testimonials and results

Help the agency owner articulate both. The balance matters: too much empathy without authority feels weak; too much authority without empathy feels cold.

### 4. Plan (The Clear Path)

**Process Plan (3-4 steps):**
1. [What the customer does first] — e.g., "Call us"
2. [What happens next] — e.g., "We assess your situation"
3. [The result] — e.g., "We solve the problem"

**Agreement Plan (Promises):**
- Commitments that address the hero's fears
- Risk reversals and guarantees
- Trust signals

### 5. Call to Action

**Direct CTA:** The one thing the client wants the customer to do.
- Must start with a verb: "Schedule," "Call," "Book," "Get"
- Must be specific: "Book your free 15-minute consultation"
- Appears multiple times across all touchpoints

**Transitional CTA:** For customers who aren't ready yet.
- Provides value in exchange for contact info
- "Download our free guide," "Take our quick assessment"
- Feeds into follow-up sequences

### 6. Success (The Transformation)

Paint the picture of what life looks like AFTER:
- External: problem is solved
- Internal: they feel confident/relieved/empowered
- Status: they've become someone better

Use before/after framing. Be specific and vivid.

### 7. Failure (The Stakes)

What happens if they DON'T take action:
- Direct consequences (problem gets worse)
- Opportunity cost (what they miss out on)
- Downward spiral (how it compounds over time)

Use sparingly — 80% success messaging, 20% failure stakes.

## The BrandScript Output

When complete, generate this document for the client's KB:

```markdown
# BrandScript: [Client Business Name]

## 1. Character (Hero)
Our customer is [description] who wants [external want] and wants to feel [internal want].

## 2. Problem
- External: [tangible problem]
- Internal: [how it makes them feel]
- Philosophical: [why it's wrong]
- Villain: [root cause]

## 3. Guide
[Client] understands [empathy]. We have [authority] to help.

## 4. Plan
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

Our promises: [agreement plan]

## 5. Call to Action
- Direct: [primary CTA]
- Transitional: [secondary CTA]

## 6. Success
[Transformation description]

## 7. Failure
[What they avoid by taking action]

## One-Liner
[Problem]. [Client] [solution] so you can [result].

## Elevator Pitch
"You know how [hero] struggles with [problem]? What we do is [solution]. So they can [success] instead of [failure]."
```

## Applying to Specific Assets

Once the BrandScript is complete, use it to generate:

| Asset | StoryBrand Elements Used |
|---|---|
| Website hero section | One-liner + Direct CTA + Stakes |
| About page | Guide (empathy + authority) + Origin story |
| Services page | Plan + Products + Success |
| Email welcome sequence | Problem → Guide → Plan → Success → CTA |
| Ad copy | Problem + Solution + CTA |
| Social media posts | Rotate through all 7 elements |
| Agent greeting | Empathy + One-liner + CTA |

## Common Mistakes to Prevent

- Agency owner describes THEMSELVES as the hero (they are the guide to their client)
- Client is positioned as the hero (the client is the guide; the client's CUSTOMER is the hero)
- Only external problems addressed (missing the emotional internal problem)
- Too many CTAs competing (one direct CTA per touchpoint)
- Features listed instead of transformation described
- Guide sounds arrogant instead of empathetic-then-authoritative
