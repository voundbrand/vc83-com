## 🔧 Technical Debt & Notes

### Known Issues
- ⚠️ 25 ESLint warnings (unused vars, mostly in generated files)
- ⚠️ No automated test suite yet (only manual integration tests)
- ⚠️ Product-Event linking requires manual objectLinks creation

### Performance Considerations
- ✅ Pagination ready (limit/offset in queries)
- ✅ Indexes on organizationId for fast multi-tenant queries
- ⚠️ Consider adding indexes to objectLinks (sourceType, targetType)

### Security Considerations
- ✅ RBAC enforced on all mutations
- ✅ Organization isolation on all queries
- ✅ Input validation in all forms
- ⚠️ Consider rate limiting for ticket issuance

## 📝 Migration Notes

### Database Schema
All tables have been migrated and seeded. Current schema includes:
- `products`, `tickets`, `events` - Core ontologies
- `objectLinks` - Relationship table
- `apps` - Registered applications
- `appAvailabilities` - Org-level app access

### Data Migration
No data migration required. All tables are new. Test data created during integration testing:
- 1 test event: "Tech Conference 2024"
- 1 test product: "VIP Pass"
- 1 test ticket: "John Doe"
- 1 objectLink: Product → Event

## 🎉 Milestone: Days 1-14 Complete!

**Summary:** The first major milestone is complete! We have successfully:
- Built 3 complete ontologies (Product, Ticket, Event)
- Created 3 frontend windows with full CRUD UIs
- Integrated all apps into the Start Menu
- Implemented universal relationship system (ObjectLinks)
- Verified end-to-end workflows with integration testing
- Maintained zero TypeScript errors and clean code quality

**Next Milestone:** Days 15-18 - UI/UX Enhancements for seamless linking and better user workflows.
