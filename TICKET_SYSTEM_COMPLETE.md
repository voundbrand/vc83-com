# Ticket System Implementation - COMPLETE

## ✅ What's Working Now

### 1. **PDF Generation** ([convex/pdfGeneration.ts](convex/pdfGeneration.ts))
- ✅ Ticket PDF with QR code, event details, order info (Eventbrite-style)
- ✅ Invoice/Receipt PDF with itemized breakdown
- ✅ Uses jsPDF for professional PDF generation
- ✅ QR codes generated via external API (qrserver.com)

### 2. **Email System** ([convex/ticketGeneration.ts](convex/ticketGeneration.ts))
- ✅ ONE consolidated email sent after checkout
- ✅ Email subject: "Your Tickets for [Event Name]"
- ✅ Clean HTML template (Eventbrite-inspired)
- ✅ ALL ticket PDFs attached
- ✅ Invoice PDF attached
- ✅ Sent via Resend from `tickets@mail.l4yercak3.com`

### 3. **Checkout Flow** ([convex/checkoutSessions.ts:756-767](convex/checkoutSessions.ts#L756))
- ✅ After successful payment:
  1. Creates tickets in database
  2. Calls `sendOrderConfirmationEmail`
  3. Generates all PDFs
  4. Sends ONE email with everything attached
- ✅ Non-blocking (won't fail checkout if email fails)

### 4. **What User Receives**
**Email:**
- Subject: "Your Tickets for [Event Name]"
- Body: Event details, order summary, instructions
- Attachments:
  - `ticket-xxxxx.pdf` (one per ticket with QR code)
  - `invoice-xxxxx.pdf` (receipt with breakdown)

**Ticket PDF Contains:**
- Event name, date, location
- QR code (for entry verification)
- Order number
- Ticket holder info
- Professional Eventbrite-style layout

**Invoice PDF Contains:**
- Order details
- Line items with quantities and prices
- Subtotal, tax (if any), total
- Payment method
- Customer info

## 🔧 Still TODO

### 1. **Confirmation Page Updates**
Current issues:
- Shows QR code placeholder (should be removed - QR is in PDF)
- "Download Receipt" button doesn't work
- "Download Ticket" button doesn't work

Needed:
- Remove QR code section entirely
- Make download buttons fetch real PDFs from backend
- Update text to mention "check your email for PDFs"

### 2. **Download Endpoints**
Need to create public actions:
```typescript
// convex/pdfGeneration.ts
export const downloadTicketPDF = action({...})  // Public
export const downloadInvoicePDF = action({...}) // Public
```

Frontend can then call:
```typescript
const ticketPDF = await api.pdfGeneration.downloadTicketPDF({
  checkoutSessionId
});
// Trigger browser download
```

### 3. **CRM/Invoice Integration** (Future)
As you mentioned:
- Invoice should be visible in your invoices app
- Connected to the CRM contact that was auto-created
- Organization can see all invoices in one place

This requires:
- Creating invoice records in your invoices system
- Linking to CRM contacts
- Adding UI to view invoices in admin

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

2. **Check email** at the customer's address
3. **Verify you receive:**

4. **Open ticket PDF:**

   - Professional layout
5. **Open invoice PDF:**
   - Should show order breakdown
   - Correct totals
   - Professional layout
