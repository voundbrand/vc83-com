## üìç Where We Left Off

### Latest Achievement: Architecture Pivot to Layer Cake Platform ‚úÖ

Just completed **major architectural updates** to transform from VC83-specific podcast app to **L4YERCAK3** - a generic multi-tenant app platform!

**What We Built**:
1. ‚úÖ Renamed `app_vc83pod` ‚Üí `app_podcasting` (generic reusable podcast app)
2. ‚úÖ Updated apps registry to Layer Cake platform branding
3. ‚úÖ Created engaging Welcome Window for non-logged-in visitors
4. ‚úÖ Updated About Window to be org-specific and editable
5. ‚úÖ Added `bio` field to organizations schema
6. ‚úÖ Fixed all TypeScript errors (0 errors currently)
7. ‚úÖ All schema indexes fixed (removed explicit `_creationTime`)

**New Platform Identity**:
- **Name**: L4YERCAK3 (Layer Cake)
- **Concept**: Stack your startup tools like a pro
- **Metaphor**: Layer on marketing superpowers (invoicing, analytics, scheduling, etc.)
- **Aesthetic**: Retro 1983 desktop with modern functionality

### Architecture Changes Summary

**Schema Updates**:
- `app_podcasting` table (was `app_vc83pod`) - now generic for any org
- `organizations.bio` field added for customizable org descriptions
- Apps now use `dataScope: "installer-owned"` for multi-tenant isolation
- Added `finance` category to app store

**New Apps in Registry**:
1. `app_podcasting` - Generic podcast management (FREE)
2. `about` - Org information (FREE)
3. `contact` - Contact forms (FREE)
4. `app_invoice` - Invoicing app (FREE for MVP)
5. `analytics` - Performance tracking ($9.99/mo)
6. `subscribers` - Email list management ($14.99/mo)
7. `scheduling` - Release planning ($4.99/mo)

**New UI Components**:
- `/src/components/window-content/welcome-window.tsx` - Engaging first impression for visitors
- `/src/components/window-content/about-window.tsx` - Org-specific, editable bio

### Previous Work: Complete Testing Infrastructure ‚úÖ

**Test Results**:
```
‚úì convex/tests/episodes.test.ts (9 tests) 
All security tests passing!
```

**SOC2 Compliance**: Complete security middleware and audit logging implemented.

## üö® CRITICAL NEXT STEP: Authentication Implementation

### Current Blocker

**You cannot test the new Welcome & About windows without auth!**

The Welcome Window shows Sign In / Sign Up buttons, but we need to implement:
1. Convex Auth setup with email/password + OAuth
2. Sign up flow that creates user + organization atomically
3. Sign in flow with organization context
4. Auth state management in the app

### Quick Context on Current State

**What's Already Done**:
- ‚úÖ Schema has `users`, `organizations`, `organizationMembers` tables
- ‚úÖ `/convex/auth.ts` exists (needs verification/completion)
- ‚úÖ Convex Auth package installed: `@convex-dev/auth`
- ‚úÖ Backend mutations for org/user management exist
- ‚úÖ Frontend has `use-auth` hook (may need updates)

**What Needs Implementation**:
- üî≤ Verify Convex Auth config in `convex/auth.ts`
- üî≤ Create sign-up mutation (user + personal org creation)
- üî≤ Create sign-in flow
- üî≤ Frontend auth UI components (login/register windows)
- üî≤ Update app layout to show Welcome Window for guests
- üî≤ Wire up auth state to show/hide windows properly

## üöÄ Quick Start Prompt for Claude Code

Copy and paste this into Claude Code to continue:

```
We just completed a major architecture pivot for vc83.com / L4YERCAK3!

LATEST CHANGES (2025-10-01):
‚úÖ Renamed podcast app from vc83-specific to generic "app_podcasting"
‚úÖ Created engaging Welcome Window for visitor engagement
‚úÖ Updated About Window to be org-specific with editable bio
‚úÖ Added bio field to organizations schema
‚úÖ Updated apps registry with Layer Cake branding
‚úÖ Fixed all TypeScript errors (0 errors)
‚úÖ Fixed all schema indexes (removed _creationTime)

NEW PLATFORM IDENTITY:
- Name: L4YERCAK3 (Layer Cake)
- Concept: Stack startup tools like layers of a cake
- Apps: Podcasting, Invoicing, Analytics, Scheduling, Subscribers
- Multi-tenant with org-scoped data isolation

CURRENT STATE:
- TypeScript: 0 errors ‚úÖ
- Tests: 9/9 passing (security validated) ‚úÖ
- Schema: Fully migrated to generic app architecture ‚úÖ
- UI: Welcome & About windows ready ‚úÖ

üö® CRITICAL BLOCKER: Need Auth Implementation!

We created a Welcome Window with Sign In / Sign Up CTAs, but auth isn't wired up yet.

KEY FILES FOR AUTH:
1. /Users/foundbrand_001/Development/vc83-com/.kiro/project_start_init/009_convex_auth_implementation.md
   - Complete auth implementation guide
   - Multi-tenant architecture details
   - User + org atomic creation pattern

2. /Users/foundbrand_001/Development/vc83-com/convex/auth.ts
   - Existing auth config (needs verification)

3. /Users/foundbrand_001/Development/vc83-com/src/hooks/use-auth.tsx
   - Frontend auth hook (may need updates)

4. /Users/foundbrand_001/Development/vc83-com/convex/organizations.ts
   - Has createOrganization mutation (lines 145-256)
   - Has updateOrganization mutation (with bio support)

AUTHENTICATION REQUIREMENTS (from 009_convex_auth_implementation.md):

1. **User Registration Flow** (ATOMIC):
   - Create user record
   - Create personal organization (auto-generated name like "John's Workspace")
   - Create membership (user as owner)
   - Set user.defaultOrgId
   - All in single transaction!

2. **Organization Structure**:
   - Every user MUST have at least one organization (their personal org)
   - Personal orgs: isPersonalWorkspace: true
   - Business orgs: isPersonalWorkspace: false
   - All data ALWAYS scoped to orgId (no exceptions)

3. **Auth Providers**:
   - Email/password (primary)
   - Microsoft OAuth (future)

4. **Session Management**:
   - Always includes current orgId
   - Can switch between orgs
   - Default to user's personal org

NEXT STEPS:

Option A: Implement Auth (RECOMMENDED - unblocks testing)
1. Review /convex/auth.ts - verify Convex Auth setup
2. Create signUp mutation (atomic user + org creation)
3. Create signIn mutation
4. Build frontend auth UI (login-window.tsx, register-window.tsx)
5. Wire up auth state to page.tsx
6. Test Welcome Window ‚Üí Sign Up ‚Üí Dashboard flow

Option B: Continue with other features
(But you won't be able to test the new Welcome/About windows without auth)

What would you like to do?
```

## üìö Key Context for Auth Implementation

### Multi-Tenant Architecture (CRITICAL)

**üö® Every user MUST have an organization from day one**

When a user signs up:
```typescript
// ATOMIC TRANSACTION
1. Create user record
2. Create personal organization:
   - name: "John's Workspace" (auto-generated)
   - isPersonalWorkspace: true
   - plan: "personal"
   - All required fields filled with defaults
3. Create membership:
   - userId: newUserId
   - organizationId: newOrgId
   - role: "owner"
4. Update user.defaultOrgId
5. Set session currentOrgId
```

**All app data is ALWAYS scoped by organizationId** - no exceptions!

### Current Schema Status

**Tables Ready for Auth**:
- ‚úÖ `users` - Has tokenIdentifier for Convex Auth
- ‚úÖ `organizations` - Has isPersonalWorkspace, plan, bio fields
- ‚úÖ `organizationMembers` - Has userId, organizationId, role
- ‚úÖ `apps` - Multi-tenant app registry
- ‚úÖ `appInstallations` - Per-org app installations
- ‚úÖ `app_podcasting` - Generic podcast app with organizationId scoping

### Files to Review/Modify

**Backend (Convex)**:
1. `convex/auth.ts` - Verify Convex Auth config
2. `convex/users.ts` or new file - signUp mutation
3. `convex/organizations.ts` - Already has createOrganization (line 145)

**Frontend (React)**:
1. `src/components/window-content/login-window.tsx` - CREATE
2. `src/components/window-content/register-window.tsx` - CREATE  
3. `src/hooks/use-auth.tsx` - UPDATE (exists but may need changes)
4. `src/app/page.tsx` - UPDATE (show Welcome Window for guests)
5. `src/components/window-content/welcome-window.tsx` - ‚úÖ DONE

### Convex Auth Resources

**Official Docs**: https://labs.convex.dev/auth
**Package**: `@convex-dev/auth` (already installed)

**Key Patterns**:
```typescript
// Backend: Define auth config
import { convexAuth } from "@convex-dev/auth/server";
import { Password } from "@convex-dev/auth/providers/Password";

export const { auth, signIn, signOut, store } = convexAuth({
  providers: [Password],
});

// Frontend: Use auth
import { useAuthActions } from "@convex-dev/auth/react";
import { useQuery } from "convex/react";
import { api } from "../convex/_generated/api";

const { signIn, signOut } = useAuthActions();
const user = useQuery(api.users.current);
```

## üéØ Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Backend Auth (2-3 hours)
1. ‚úÖ Verify `convex/auth.ts` configuration
2. ‚úÖ Create `signUp` mutation (atomic user + org creation)
3. ‚úÖ Create user queries (getCurrentUser, etc.)
4. ‚úÖ Test with Convex dashboard

### Phase 2: Frontend Auth UI (2-3 hours)  
1. ‚úÖ Create `login-window.tsx` component
2. ‚úÖ Create `register-window.tsx` component
3. ‚úÖ Update `use-auth.tsx` hook
4. ‚úÖ Add auth provider to app layout

### Phase 3: Integration (1-2 hours)
1. ‚úÖ Wire Welcome Window to show for guests
2. ‚úÖ Wire dashboard to show for authenticated users
3. ‚úÖ Test full flow: Visit ‚Üí Sign Up ‚Üí Dashboard
4. ‚úÖ Test About Window with org context

### Phase 4: Polish (1 hour)
1. ‚úÖ Add loading states
2. ‚úÖ Add error handling
3. ‚úÖ Add success messages
4. ‚úÖ Test edge cases

**Total Estimated Time**: 6-9 hours for complete auth implementation

## ‚úÖ Quality Checks

Always run these after making changes:
```bash
npm run typecheck   # Must pass with 0 errors
npm run lint        # Fix any new issues  
npm run test        # All tests should pass (9/9 currently)
npm run build       # Ensure prod build works
```

**Testing Auth**:
- Manual testing in browser required
- Test sign up flow end-to-end
- Test sign in flow
- Test org context in About Window
- Verify audit logs are created
