# SOC2 Implementation Roadmap

**Created**: 2025-10-01  
**Status**: Ready to Begin  
**Target**: SOC2 Type II Compliance

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the complete path to SOC2 compliance for vc83.com. The work is organized into 3 priority levels with clear timelines and success criteria.

## ðŸ”´ Priority 1: Critical (Week 1) - DO BEFORE LAUNCH

**Timeline**: 5-6 days  
**Goal**: Fix critical security gaps that would fail SOC2 audit

### Task SOC2-001: Security Middleware Refactor
**Time**: 2-3 days  
**File**: `SOC2_001_security_middleware_refactor.md`

**What**: Refactor ALL queries and mutations to use consistent security middleware

**Why**: Prevents accidental data leaks, ensures consistent permission checks

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] New security middleware helpers (`publicQuery`, `authenticatedQuery`, `creatorOnlyMutation`)
- [ ] All mutations use `orgScopedMutation()` with mandatory audit logging
- [ ] `app_vc83pod.ts` fully refactored
- [ ] All other files audited and updated
- [ ] Documentation of security patterns

**Success**: Zero manual security checks, all endpoints use middleware

---

### Task SOC2-002: Data Isolation Test Suite
**Time**: 1-2 days  
**File**: `SOC2_002_data_isolation_tests.md`

**What**: Comprehensive automated tests proving organizations cannot access each other's data

**Why**: SOC2 auditors require proof of multi-tenant isolation

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] Test framework setup (Vitest + Convex testing)
- [ ] App installation isolation tests
- [ ] Private-tool data isolation tests
- [ ] Shared-content permission tests
- [ ] RBAC enforcement tests
- [ ] 100% test pass rate

**Success**: Automated proof that Org A cannot access Org B's data

---

### Task SOC2-003: Audit Log Enhancement
**Time**: 1 day  
**File**: `SOC2_003_audit_log_enhancement.md`

**What**: Add IP address and user agent tracking to all audit logs

**Why**: Required for forensic analysis and incident investigation

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] IP address extraction from HTTP headers
- [ ] User agent capture
- [ ] Updated security middleware to include context
- [ ] Next.js middleware for IP forwarding
- [ ] Privacy policy update (GDPR compliance)
- [ ] Audit log retention policy (90 days)

**Success**: All audit logs have populated `ipAddress` and `userAgent` fields

---

### Task SOC2-004: Guest Access Documentation
**Time**: 1 day  
**File**: `SOC2_004_guest_access_documentation.md`

**What**: Document which endpoints allow guest access and why each is secure

**Why**: SOC2 auditors need proof that guest access is intentional, not a bug

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] `GUEST_ACCESS_POLICY.md` (complete policy document)
- [ ] `SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` (developer guide)
- [ ] JSDoc comments on all guest-accessible endpoints

## Getting Started

### Recommended Approach

**Option 1: Sequential (Safest)**
1. Complete SOC2-001 first (3 days)
2. Then SOC2-002 (2 days)
3. Then SOC2-003 (1 day)
4. Then SOC2-004 (1 day)
**Total: 1 week**

**Option 2: Parallel (Faster)**
- Developer 1: SOC2-001 (security refactor)
- Developer 2: SOC2-002 (test suite)
- Developer 3: SOC2-003 + SOC2-004 (audit logs + docs)
**Total: 3-4 days**

### First Steps (Today)

1. **Review this roadmap** with your team
2. **Choose approach** (sequential or parallel)
3. **Assign tasks** to team members
4. **Start with SOC2-001** (security middleware refactor)
5. **Schedule daily standups** to track progress

### Questions?

If you have questions about any task:
1. Read the detailed task file (SOC2_00X_*.md)
2. Check the main compliance analysis (SOC2_COMPLIANCE_ANALYSIS.md)
3. Ask for clarification before starting implementation
