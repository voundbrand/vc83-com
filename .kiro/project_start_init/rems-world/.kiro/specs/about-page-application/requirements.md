# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The About Page is a web page that will be styled to look like a desktop application window within the existing Rem's World retro desktop interface. This page will consolidate personal and professional information from the existing Bio and Resume components into a single page with a tabbed interface. The page will feature a Bio section with personal narrative and professional README, and a Resume section with detailed work experience, skills, and certifications, all presented in authentic retro Mac OS styling that mimics a desktop application window.

## Source Components Reference

The implementation should utilize the existing component structure and content from:

- **Bio Component**: `.kiro/specs/about-page-application/components/bio.tsx` - Contains profile card, social links, nested Bio/README tabs with personal narrative and professional working style information
- **Resume Component**: `.kiro/specs/about-page-application/components/resume.tsx` - Contains detailed work experience, skills categorization, certifications, and contact information
- **Page Structure**: `.kiro/specs/about-page-application/page.tsx` - Shows the overall layout and component integration approach

These components contain the exact content structure, styling patterns, and data organization that should be adapted for the desktop application format.
