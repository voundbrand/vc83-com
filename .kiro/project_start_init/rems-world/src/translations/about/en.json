Meanwhile I grew my marketing agency to €240K+ ARR. We learned how to grow relationships from €300/month to €5K/month by actually solving problems instead of just selling services.\n\nI started building my own event management platform in February 2025 as a way to inject myself into the startup scene in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and branch out to Berlin. Everyone needs events, so I figured it was a good entry point. As a tech enthusiast with coding experience and sales expertise who loves to teach, I'm always looking for opportunities to help teams build better products.\n\nI live in Pasewalk, Germany but travel back to Northern California once or twice a year (3-4 weeks) to connect with family and get some proper California sun.",
